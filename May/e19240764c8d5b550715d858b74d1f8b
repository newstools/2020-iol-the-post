Durban - Video footage of three car thieves has emerged after a car was stolen from outside a home in Effingham, north of Durban, on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the complainant alleged that on 26 May, at 03.30am, he noticed that his vehicle which was parked at his place of residence at Tasneem Crescent in Greenwood Park was stolen. The car is yet to be found. A 35 second video clip captured by a CCTV camera showed a car stopping two properties away from where the vehicle was parked. Two men got off and walked along the road to the car parked on the roadside. The house is below road level. The men split up and walk towards the drivers door and passenger door. One of them has a knap-sack. He inspects the front of the car. A third person appears and he keeps watch of the house to see if anyone in the house has awoken. The footage does not show how they stole the car. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
