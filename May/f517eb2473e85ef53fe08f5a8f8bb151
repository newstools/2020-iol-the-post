"The police officers attempted to stop the said vehicle but they sped off. "A chase ensued and the vehicle was intercepted on Magwaza Maphalala Road." Mbele said police conducted a search and the driver, aged 30, was allegedly found in possession of an unlicensed firearm with seven rounds of ammunition. She said the passenger, aged 21, was found in possession of a knife with bloodstains. "The suspects were charged for being in illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition as well as for being in possession of a dangerous weapon.
