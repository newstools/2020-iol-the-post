Durban – Disgruntled eThekwini Municipality contractors have torched several electricity sub-stations across Durban after their contracts were not renewed. Thousands of ratepayers were left without electricity in various suburbs in Durban on Monday after sub-stations were set on fire. Among the sub-stations broken into and set on fire include Overport, Westville, Mayville and KwaMashu. According to several social media posts, the acts of sabotage was a result of the City terminating the contracts of some electrical contractors. The City has, however, denied this. Ethekwini Municipality spokesman, Mswawakhe Mayisela confirmed to IOL there were “multiple acts of sabotage by sub-contractors to its city-wide infrastructure”. He said a number of substations were broken into, vandalised, switched off and some of them torched leading to multiple power outages across the city. “Thousands of customers were left without electricity and the cost of the damage to infrastructure is estimated to run into hundreds of thousands of rands,” Mayisela said. “The damage to much-needed infrastructure was an act of sabotage from sub-contractors dissatisfied with contractual agreements negotiated between the main contractor and the Municipality.  Perpetrators have been identified and will be facing criminal charges and blacklisting by the Municipality. Anyone seen perpetuating further damage to infrastructure will face the same might,” he said. Mayisela said contrary to social media reports, no contracts were terminated. He, however, confirmed the contract would be coming to an end next month. “The Municipality only has a legal relationship with the main contractor. It is the contractor’s responsibility to communicate with subcontractors any information necessary at the time,” Mayisela said. Daily News
