Durban – MARGARET Francis Pillay has been dealt a double blow. Her home in Laudium, Pretoria, was gutted by a fire last Monday, killing her bedridden sister, Ella Ebrahim, and her niece, Michelle Pillay. Ebrahim, 75, died after the roof of the bedroom she was sleeping in collapsed. She also suffered smoke inhalation and burns to her body. Pillay, 52, who was unemployed, was rescued by Muhammed Momi Dockrat, a 19-year-old volunteer firefighter from Laudium Disaster Management. However, she sustained severe burns to her hands and face and died in hospital on Friday. Margaret Pillay said she had been dropping off her granddaughter, who also lived with her, at work when her neighbour called to tell her about the fire. “The neighbour told me that my house was on fire and that I must return home quickly. As I got closer to my home, all I could see were flames and smoke. People were gathered outside. “As I got out of my vehicle, I burst into tears as I called out for Ella and Michelle.” The 78-year-old said she saw the paramedics attending to Pillay. “Her face and her hands were burnt. She looked like she was unconscious.” Margaret said Pillay’s funeral was held on Saturday. “Ella’s funeral has not yet been held due to investigations. We still don’t know how the fire started. But everything was destroyed.” She said she was living with family. Ibraheem Dockrat from Laudium Disaster Management said the cause of the fire had not been determined. Captain Mavela Masondo, a spokesperson for the Gauteng SAPS, said the cause of the fire was under investigation. POST
