In a separate incident, in September, a mother of three was convicted of dumping her baby in a storm water drain and sentenced to three years in prison. The baby girl was rescued after community members heard a baby crying in a storm water drain in Barracuda Road and Herring Circle in Newlands East in February 2019. The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her minor children, was sentenced in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court. Earlier this year, Open Arms SA, an organisation that helps with orphaned babies, appealed to women not to dump their newborn babies. They advised expectant mothers to seek advice on where they could leave their babies if they did not want to keep them. IOL
