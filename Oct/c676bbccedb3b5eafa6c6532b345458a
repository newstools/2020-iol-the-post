Durban – The family of a pensioner who was allegedly assaulted by her granddaughter and died will not be opening a case. The Department of Social Development said details regarding the murder were sketchy, but it is alleged the woman, 68, was severely assaulted by her granddaughter, 18, in Inzinga, Midlands, west of Howick. The family rushed the grandmother to a local clinic, where she died. Yesterday, the woman’s son said his family was very upset about her death. He was asleep at the time of the incident and did not know what happened, but said his sister might know. “I was woken up and she was already dead,” he said. He grew up with his mother and said she was motherly and not violent. After getting a job he moved out, but visited her frequently. He confirmed the family would not be opening a case. Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza called upon law enforcement agencies to investigate the circumstances surrounding the murder of the senior citizen. “It is disheartening unbelievable that this pensioner died at the hands of someone who was supposed to protect her. The abuse directed at our senior citizens is very concerning. “We are shocked and outraged by the murder. We are severely pained by the continuous killing of the elderly.” She called on communities to stand up against crimes against the elderly. Daily News
