Durban – Metro police have cautioned people to be vigilant on the roads, especially in wet weather, after an accident claimed the lives of three young men on Sunday. According to Leon Fourie, of Life Response, paramedics were dispatched to a serious collision on Old North Coast Road just before the R102 in Durban a little after noon. Two vehicles had collided and three men in their early 20s were trapped in one car, he said. They were already dead.  Fourie said the three occupants from the other vehicle sustained moderate injuries and were treated at the scene before being taken to hospital. According to metro police spokesperson Parbhoo Sewpersad, the two vehicles were allegedly travelling in opposite directions on Old North Coast Road when the collision occurred. Sewpersad said: “Metro search and rescue members working alongside Ethekwini Fire Rescue and Life Response Rescue used cutters and spreaders to free the entrapped deceased persons.” Sewpersad urged drivers to be extra caution on the roads during wet weather. He said the cause of the collision was unknown and subject to an SAPS investigation. In a separate accident, five people were injured after the vehicle they were travelling in rolled down a 20m embankment on the M13 at Field’s Hill, Pinetown, on Sunday. Michelle Smith, of Meditech EMS, said: “Due to the adverse weather conditions causing slippery ground and poor access to the vehicle, a team from Rescuetech were dispatched to assist in retrieving the patients from down the embankment.” POST
