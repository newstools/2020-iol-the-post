Durban - KIDNAPPED businessman Hamza Khan has been found and his alleged kidnapper arrested. Khan, 30, was kidnapped by two armed men posing as policemen, outside his family’s butchery in Forsdburg, Johannesburg, on September 18. Last Tuesday afternoon, he was traced to a house in Clifton Street in Mayfair where he was freed by police and returned to his family. It is alleged that he was kept in a locked room. The kidnappers demanded R200 000 ransom from his family. Yusuf Abramjee, a crime activist, said an Egyptian national 48, who owns coffee lounges in Johannesburg, was arrested in Norwood shortly afterwards. Just under R100 000 was recovered and the suspect’s bakkie was seized. A day after the arrest, members from the community and business owners protested outside the suspect’s business in Fordsburg. They demanded the shop be closed as it would impact negatively on their businesses. Four other businessmen were kidnapped in Fordsburg and Mayfair recently. “The four cases had the exact same modus operandi. “In three of the cases, the victims were returned to their families. In two of the cases, ransoms were paid,” said Abramjee. He said a businessman who had been kidnapped in January was still missing. Abramjee believes there will be further arrests. Captain Mavela Masondo, the spokesperson for the Gauteng SAPS, confirmed that Khan was found. “One suspect was arrested and remanded in custody. He is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court again on Friday, facing charges of kidnapping and extortion.” POST
