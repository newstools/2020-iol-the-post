Durban - THE community of Depot Road Memorial Primary School will next month plant 160 banana trees to mark the 160th anniversary of the arrival of Indians to the country. “This is a simple but symbolic gesture,” said Yogs Moodley, the principal. The school, in Bayview, Chatsworth, has its origins in Magazine Barracks, a compound for municipal workers near the Durban beachfront. The area was destroyed in 1965 and the community was moved to Chatsworth because of the Group Areas Act. Depot Road Memorial Primary was the community’s school. “When we arrived here, the banana farmers were forced by the apartheid government to give up their land,” said Moodley. By recultivating the land, the school community wants to make a statement about history, food security and self- reliance. The pupils are the first group to contribute trees from their homes. Moodley said the project would be part of the curriculum - with the children nurturing and monitoring the growth of their contributions. The project is a partnership with the Magazine Barracks Remembrance Association, the Durban Book Fair and Made in Chatsworth. The anniversary will be commemorated on November 16. The school is also looking for a family who can donate a traditional grinding stone that will be mounted as a tribute to the working people. Members of the community interested in contributing banana trees or a grinding stone can call the principal at 0314005404 or 0314004646. POST
