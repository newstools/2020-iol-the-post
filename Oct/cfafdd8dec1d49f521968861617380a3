Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police have arrested a 62-year-old man for the hacking murder of a 34-year-old mother and her two-year-old child. The mother and child were hacked to death on Solly Mathe Road in Mount Royal, a housing scheme between Phoenix and KwaMashu on Wednesday. A man known to them fled the scene shortly after the incident which led to a man hunt for him. Police spokesman, Brigadier Jay Naicker said local police along with the K9 unit worked tirelessly throughout the night searching for the man involved in the gruesome murders, “ In the middle of the night, the suspect was spotted sneaking back into the house. He was placed under arrest and was found wearing a bloodied shirt. Police seized his shirt for further investigation. The victims have not been identified by their next-of-kin. The 62-year-old suspect is in police custody and will appear before the Verulam Magistrate’s Court soon,” Naicker said. eThekwini ward councillor Pete Graham said the suspect had been renting a room on the property. It is alleged the woman and her daughter came to visit him on Wednesday when they were attacked. The police top brass has commended officers for the arrest. “I commend all involved in the apprehension of the suspect accused of gender based violence.
