Durban - A MAN suspected of stealing fuel is due to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court soon after he was arrested at the weekend in Durban North. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a 43-year-old man was arrested for theft on Saturday. The man has been linked to the theft of fuel in Pietermaritzburg and the Bluff. It is alleged that the man, driving a white Mercedes-Benz, filled up with fuel worth R450 in Pietermaritzburg and left without paying. Mbele said Pietermaritzburg police were investigating a case of theft. “It is alleged on October 14 at 10am, a vehicle driven by a man went to fill up petrol at a service station on Echo Road. While the petrol attendant was busy checking the tyre pressure after being asked to by the driver, he immediately drove off without paying,” said Mbele. SA Petroleum Retailers Association national director Vishal Premlall said they supported all efforts made by the policing authorities to curb this criminal activity. “It is refreshing to see that policing is more pronounced. Fuel theft in forecourts has grown exponentially during Covid-19. It is a trend that is expected during a state of disaster and may be attributed to increased unemployment,” said Premlall. “We are also aware of many retail sites operating with reduced staff numbers on the forecourts, which may be why they are being targeted.” Premlall said they were happy to work with the authorities to create awareness of the challenges. They have a “whistle-blower hotline” where cases with evidence can be reported - https://sapra.co.za/whistle-blower/. Daily News
