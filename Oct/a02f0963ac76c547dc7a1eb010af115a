DURBAN - The South African Police Service (SAPS) confirmed on Tuesday an officer has been accused of raping a 24-year-old woman inside a police station in KwaMakhutha, Durban. Brigadier Jay Naicker, media liaison for the SAPS, said in a statement on Tuesday the officer who allegedly committed the crime has since been subjected to an internal disciplinary process and a criminal investigation by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). “I am confident that investigators at Ipid will ensure that the perpetrator faces the full might of the law. We are also pleased that the police officer is facing internal disciplinary processes,” said KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula. It is alleged that on September 25, the 32-year-old suspect and the victim got into an argument at a tuck shop in KwaMakhutha, near Amanzimtoti, on the south coast of KZN. The suspect allegedly took the woman to the KwaMakhutha police station to reach a consensus. “Whilst at the police station the victim was allegedly raped by the suspect before she was released,” Naicker said. After reporting the matter to her grandmother, the victim was taken to a nearby clinic, where they confirmed the victim's ordeal and immediately reported it to the KwaMakhutha police station. The station commander opened up a case against the suspect and informed Ipid of the allegations against him. Naicker explained the suspect had not attended work since being served with a notice of disciplinary investigation against him. African News Agency (ANA)
