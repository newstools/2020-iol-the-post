IN THE DAILY NEWS October 3 edition, the story “Swansong for sound engineer” on page 3 incorrectly stated that Abdul Sabbir Khan, 71, who died last Tuesday, was the founder and director of Azam Khan Sounds Services. It also stated that the business was named after his son Azam Khan. The founding member, according to a Durban High Court judgment, is Younus Khan, 77. He is Khan’s eldest brother and founded the business in 1964. The name of the company was attained after Younus consulted with a priest to have him bless his business by way of prayer and to recommend a suitable name for the enterprise. The late Khan had asked to use Younus’s trading name Azam Khan, to which he had agreed. Both used the name in the 1980s. The business is now managed by Younus’s son Abdul Kader Khan. The error is regretted. Daily News
