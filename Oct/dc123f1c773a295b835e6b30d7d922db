Durban - POLICE were on Sunday still searching for the body of a 33-year-old man who drowned at Tinley Manor beach in Ballito on Thursday. This was confirmed by spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala yesterday. IPSS Medical Rescue paramedic Paul Herbst said the man was apparently having a braai on the unprotected beach with his colleague when he decided to go for a swim. Herbst said that on Saturday IPSS Medical Rescues Search and Rescue division - with police divers from Durban SAPS Search and Rescue, K9 Search and Rescue, NSRI and KwaDukuza lifeguards - returned to Tinley Manor main beach to continue the search. “Shoreline patrols north and south of the area were conducted in conjunction with a microlight and a drone,” he said. Herbst said the search resumed when the weather and sea conditions were good. “We managed to launch two vessels and a drone. We searched all the way from Salt Rock to further north, towards Blythedale Beach. We went approximately one kilometre out to sea, unfortunately with negative results. We have also asked the guys with microlights to have a look for us when they are flying past, but unfortunately we haven’t found anything.” KwaDukuza Municipality spokesperson Sipho Mkhize said Tinley Manor beach was unprotected in terms of shark nets and not the absence of lifeguards. Meanwhile, with most Durban beaches open again eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela has urged bathers to be cautious. “Bathing where there are no lifeguards is discouraged no matter how good you are at swimming.” Daily News
