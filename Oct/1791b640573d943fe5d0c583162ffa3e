Durban - The South African Police Service (SAPS) said successful law enforcement required working together and sharing information and intelligence across provincial boundaries. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the continuous and positive collaboration between the SAPS, the Metro Police, municipalities and other stakeholders to share ideas, strategies and information with the aim of ensuring a  safe and secure environment for all citizens of this country prompted an engagement between law enforcement counterparts from Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in Port Elizabeth and the eThekwini municipality in Durban. Naidu said a delegation led by the Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) District Commander, Policing, Brigadier Ronald Koll accompanied by the Commissioner of NMB Metro Police, Yolande Faro and her team visited the Durban Central police station to exchange and gain best practices relating to the safety of citizens using the pristine beaches in both provinces. The Acting Station Commander of SAPS Durban Central, Colonel Rajen Parumasur gave an inspiring presentation relating to the beach patrols and partnerships within the eThekwini municipality which made a huge difference in the decline of crime along the promenade known as the Golden Mile. “The exchange of information between the two metros was very insightful with both the SAPS and Metro police highlighting their best practices as a way forward,” said Naidu. “Crime has no boundaries and similar challenges were highlighted by both metros. The team from NMB metro appreciated the time and efforts of the eThekwini municipality and district in making their visit worthwhile. Lots of new ideas were born out of this information sharing session.” Naidu said the visit reached an apex when the team did an on sight visit to the 24 hour satellite police station on the beachfront.
