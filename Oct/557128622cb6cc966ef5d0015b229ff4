 Durban - Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Blade Nzimande on Tuesday welcomed the sentence imposed on the “brutal murderers” of University of Zululand (UniZulu) Professor Gregory Kamwendo, who was killed in 2018. The Pietermaritzburg High Court last week convicted and sentenced Oscar Mkhuliseni Mthiyane, 53, and Selby Nkuna, 49, to life imprisonment for the murder. “This was a double murder as it took the life of Prof Kamwendo at the height of his career, but also this killing exposed corruption and self-interest which seek to destroy the image and credibility of not only UniZulu but of the higher education system as a whole,” said Nzimande. Nzimande said even though the conviction of the murderers would not bring back Kamwendo, it would hopefully deliver justice for a heinous crime and contribute towards his family, colleagues and the UniZulu community finding closure. The minister thanked the African criminal justice system, particularly the South African Police Service (SAPS), the prosecuting authority and the courts for ensuring a swift arrest and sentencing of the murderers. “They (the murderers) indeed deserve to be incarcerated for the pain that they brought to the Kamwendo family and our entire post-school education and training community,” said Nzimande. Kamwendo, 53, was killed after parking his vehicle outside one of the flats on Durford Road in Empangeni on May 22, 2018. He sustained multiple bullet wounds to the upper body and was declared dead at the scene. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala told Independent Media that Nkuna, one of the two men convicted for the murder, was a lecturer at the same institution as Kamwendo. African News Agency
