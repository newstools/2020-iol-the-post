OPINION - It is terribly irresponsible of Julius Malema to stir racial tensions in Senekal after a young farm worker was brutally murdered. As a shrewd politician, he knows that the only way to keep his voters from holding him accountable for their sorry state is to create a diversion. Malema makes this killing a racial one and incites a civil war. His utterances gain him some space in the media but, more importantly, serve to detract from the real issues confronting people in the country. He talks as though we are under an apartheid state ruled by the white National Party. Wake up and smell the coffee, Mr Malema. Political power in South Africa has moved firmly into the hands of black people. Malema himself was part of the ruling party for many years. During this time, black people, in general, have seen little improvement in their lives. In some instances, the situation has worsened. Over 12 million South Africans, mostly blacks, are without jobs, live in poverty and in deplorable conditions in squatter settlements. The only ones to benefit from black political power are the black political elite, Malema included. The irony of his plan to march to the courts in Senekal is that those following him remain oppressed under a black government. They have no jobs, food, housing, decent education or access to quality health-care, all of which pales into insignificance as their leader wages war with white farmers. Malema is a threat to our democracy. It’s time his followers asked him what he has done to improve their lives. Marching to Senekal won’t put food in their hungry stomachs.
