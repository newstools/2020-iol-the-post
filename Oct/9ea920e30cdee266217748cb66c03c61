Durban - ROBBERS made off with R300 000 worth of jewellery during a house robbery in Phoenix yesterday. Homeowner Morris Pillay, 65, said he was supervising his employees while they were cleaning the yard before 7am. Pillay, a building contractor, said a white Toyota Etios drove up to his house. Four men wearing masks and caps got out and pointed firearms at them. His employees were made to lay face down on the floor. Two men grabbed Pillay by his shirt and pulled him into the house. Pillay screamed to alert his wife, who was in the bedroom, and she locked the door. “One guy had a rifle and the other a pistol. They wanted money and the whereabouts of a safe. I was terrified. You cannot put up a fight. I pleaded with my wife to open the door. When she did they barged in. "With the gun pointing at me I handed over the safe keys. They grabbed my wife’s cellphone,” he said. The jewellery included watches and rings of sentimental value to the family. “They removed two pillowcases and stuffed the jewellery inside them like a carrier bag. We are lucky to be alive. I just kept praying in my mind for them not to harm us. I thought having a safe would be safe. They left and we pressed the panic button,” Pillay said. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the robbery, saying a case was opened at Phoenix police station. Private security company KZN VIP Unit spokesperson Glen Naidoo said the men fled in a white Toyota Etios with NDW number plates. Daily News
