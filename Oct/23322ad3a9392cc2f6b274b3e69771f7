Durban – THE KZN Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs has warned residents across the north-western parts of the province of the risk of severe thunderstorms which are expected to hit these areas Monday afternoon into the evening. In a statement on Monday morning, MEC Sipho Hlomuka said his department had received reports from the SA Weather Service indicating severe storms may result in heavy downpours, hail and excessive lightning in the areas under the Zululand, uMkhanyakude, uMgungundlovu, uMzinyathi, uThukela, and Harry Gwala districts. "The expected thunderstorms bring with them the possibility of localised flooding in low-lying areas and the risk of damage to critical infrastructure and housing, particularly in informal settlements," said Hlomuka. He urged residents to exercise caution as such weather conditions continued to pose a serious risk to human life in the province. “We are appealing to communities to abide by the latest weather warnings. Those who are caught in these weather conditions outdoors are urged to seek shelter immediately. Those who are utilising routes that cross rivers are urged not to cross flooded walkways,” he said. He had already placed disaster management teams on high alert in all the listed areas. The teams will be monitoring routes and areas prone to localised flooding. Motorists were also warned to drive with caution. Daily News
