Durban - FOUR Greenwood Park police officers are currently out on bail after appearing in court on Tuesday on charges of kidnapping, theft and extortion. Police constables Nhlanhla Goodman Mthembu, 35, Strinjen Pillay, 32, Khulekani Shezi, 41, Douglas Dube, 32, and Kethokuhle Mzoke, 36, made their first appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court before magistrate Vanitha Armu. They were arrested on Monday. Prosecutor Kuveshni Pillay said on June 16, the constables stopped outside Twins Bottle Store in Greenwood Park and found a man, the complainant, in possession of cigarettes. They allegedly took him to Workington Road recreational grounds and his home in Greenwood Park. Thereafter, they allegedly took him to the SAPS Greenwood Park where they charged him under the Disaster Management Act for being in possession of cigarettes during the Covid-19 lockdown restriction period. Pillay said the man’s cigarettes and money was taken. She said only R2 000 was booked in, his case was also not placed on the court roll, and the charges against him were withdrawn. According to the charge sheet, the accused did unlawfully and intentionally induce or subject to pressure or inspire fear in the mind of the man in contravention of the Disaster Management Act. They allegedly took R11 500 from him. They were also charged with theft of R11 500 and cigarettes to the value of R12 000. Mthembu’s bail application was opposed because he had a pending case of theft at the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court and was out on bail for that matter. He was remanded into custody until November 5. Armu granted the others bail of R3 000 each on condition that they do not interfere or communicate with the man. The case was adjourned for further investigation until December 7. Daily News
