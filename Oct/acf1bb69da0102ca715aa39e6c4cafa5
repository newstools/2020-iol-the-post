Durban - ROBERT Chise’s murder case was adjourned to October 20 for investigations, pending his bail application, the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court ruled yesterday. The 21-year-old Malawian was charged with the murder of Hillcrest resident Leighton Frank Agg, 42, who was reported missing on September 30 and was later found dead. He is also facing charges of housebreaking and robbery. Agg’s body was discovered last Wednesday under a bridge in Clare Ridge near Pietermaritzburg. His car was found in Pietermaritzburg two days after he went missing. Both the State and defence expected Chise to plead guilty yesterday. However, he did an about-turn. Preparations for a bail application began, with the State and defence saying they had put bail issues on the back-burner, as they had been “fast tracking the plea”. Chise’s Legal Aid attorney told the court his client was no longer pleading guilty. He said Chise indicated he had asylum seeker documents, even though these had expired in August. Chise claimed these documents were taken by police. “They also took his passport,” said the attorney. He requested copies of these documents and said there needed to be clarity made on the expired papers in relation to renewals and Covid-19. Prosecutor A Clive said the State would have to verify whether Chise had these documents, and there was no indication of these documents in the docket. Clive asked for Chise to be remanded in custody at Hillcrest Police Station so the State could have Home Affairs assist with his movement status. Clive indicated the State would be opposing bail. Chise, according to the charge sheet, is alleged to have broken into Agg’s home with others, where Agg was assaulted and robbed of his laptop, two cellphones, a wallet with bank cards and an undisclosed amount of money, and his Ford Bantam. Chise, acting in common purpose with others, is alleged to have murdered Agg by assaulting him with “a hammer, electric cord and also stabbing him using a knife”. Daily News
