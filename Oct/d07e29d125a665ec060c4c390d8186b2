JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (ANA) - South Africa’s Eskom said on Monday work was set to resume on the final leg of an approximately 123 km transmission power line running through the uMgungundlovu and uThukela district municipalities of KwaZulu-Natal province. In a statement, the state power utility said final construction of the 47 km leg of this power line would start from the existing Venus substation in Estcourt and end at the existing Ariadne substation in the provincial capital Pietermaritzburg. Since 2005, the utility has been expanding its infrastructure through additional power stations and power lines, as well strengthening and upgrading existing electricity infrastructure. “This project will enable Eskom to fulfil its mandate of electricity provision to users in the area, as well as the entire province of KwaZulu-Natal,” grid manager at Eskom Transmission Bob Naraghi said. “On completion, the project will not only contribute to improved stability of the transmission network, but will also create a more flexible network that will enhance electricity reliability. More importantly, this line will also contribute to the economic growth of the province.” Eskom said the project had set into motion social and economic changes by creating 190 job opportunities ranging from professional, skilled, semi-skilled and the unskilled workforce, benefitting communities within the municipalities affected by the construction. This, it said, would offset some of the far-reaching effects of the Covid-19 pandemic which had pushed millions of people into unemployment, underemployment or poverty. About 70 percent of the employed workforce has been recruited from the locals within the relevant towns. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Stella Mapenzauswa
