We would like to thank the Hawks for their tireless efforts, as well as the general public for keeping Sandra in their thoughts and prayers daily. We are elated and relieved to have her back with us safely." Naicker said his sister was allowed to make calls home while in captivity. He said she was recovering from the trauma. POST
