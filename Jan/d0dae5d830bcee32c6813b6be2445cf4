 She was missing since New Year’s eve, she was picked up by a white car in her pijamas at about 9:30 pm in New Germany KZN. She is been found in eMbumbulu this morning brutally murdered. Her name is Zinhle Muthwa. pic.twitter.com/4aOnXl8i5G   My thoughts exactly, I think women need to share as much info with their friends, ie name of the guy, pictures too. Whenever they're going out with the a man doesn't matter if it's at night or daytime, they must share that info💔💔💔   She's my best friend she's been found but noy alive... Driving down to kzn tomorrow thank you fot every one who helped look for her. ❤️   I can’t believe that we staring the new year with this again 😢condolences to her family and friends 💔 pic.twitter.com/PI9JGlJnRR
