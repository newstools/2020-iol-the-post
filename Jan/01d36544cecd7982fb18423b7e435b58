Durban - Former Durban Mayor Zandile Gumede's court appearance on Wednesday got off to a dramatic start when one of her co-accused fell ill. Medics had to be called in to assess the man. The media were also barred from taking photographs of Gumede in court.     Earlier in the morning, journalists were told that only the first 10 media representatives would be allowed in and the doors were locked thereafter. Court officials claimed that the court was full.     Journalists were also ordered to switch off their cellphones and recording devices. They were also barred from taking photographs or filming Gumede in court.         Gumede is facing a raft of charges relating to a fraudulent Durban Solid Waste tender. In court, it was revealed that the state had found new evidence which increases the total amount of fraud and corruption proceedings to R389 million.         The Mercury
