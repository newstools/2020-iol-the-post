Durban - THOUSANDS of litres of alcohol were confiscated in a joint operation between the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Economic Development and the police yesterday at a liquor wholesaler in uMlazi. Some of the alcohol being sold at Panjivan’s Liquors was three months past the best before date. As police were busy identifying thousands of litres of alcohol which ranged from ciders to beer, unsuspecting customers were being informed by authorities that some of the alcohol they had bought had expired. One such customer was Luvuyo Mpinga, who had bought R552 worth of alcohol for his friend Nobuhle Maqobo’s birthday party. “We were shocked. We don’t know how it would have affected us after drinking and the people at the party would have blamed us for making them sick,” he said. As officials identified the alcohol that was to be taken, the management of the store tried to explain why they sold the alcohol to the public. However, they declined to comment when approached by the Daily News. Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (Edtea) MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said the raid consisted of officials from the SAPS, eThekwini Environmental Health, which will be investigating the actual product, and the Consumer Protection Unit within the Edtea, who will be compiling a report on the raid and charting a way forward. She said there had been inspections taking place throughout the province, since the beginning of July. There were more than 10 liquor outlets that were shutdown for contravening the Disaster Management Act. The MEC said the inspections were ongoing. She would be making an announcement in the next few weeks about this. “The majority of liquor traders are complying. This is aimed at consumers. The department has a responsibility to protect consumers,” she said. Daily News
