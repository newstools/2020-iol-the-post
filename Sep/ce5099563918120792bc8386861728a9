Durban - POLICE Minister Bheki Cele said police officers should receive psychological training to help them improve their mental strength so they can react appropriately under difficult policing situations. Cele was reflecting on policing under the lockdown, and some incidents of police brutality reported during this time. Speaking on Radio 702 yesterday, Cele said the level of police brutality in society was, and still is, unacceptable and could not be tolerated. The minister said police reaction in dealing with certain matters needed to be part of their training to enhance policing. He said new training methods were required urgently to assist police with psychology and wellness training. “Some of the police officers will do things that you just can’t explain. “As leadership, we are working on a new training curriculum and bringing in social workers to work with the police. “We are also trying to enhance the wellness elements,” said Cele. He said that in future the police service was looking into creating its own medical unit that would work to improve the mental strength of the police. “We have realised that there are issues, and we are trying to work on them going forward,” said Cele. During the lockdown, statistics by the SAPS revealed a decline in the crime rate in the country. This included crimes such as rape, murders, robberies and drunk driving. Cele said police visibility pushed back criminals, and the absence of alcohol also contributed to the downward trend. However, Cele acknowledged that there were mistakes made by the police during the lockdown. He said lessons had been learned. “Some police officers became rogue during this period. “Several of them were arrested for wrongdoing, stealing and manhandling communities. “However, some managed to learn quickly and were able to stay within the law. “We have learnt a lesson and we believe that next time if such things happen, life would be better,” said Cele.
