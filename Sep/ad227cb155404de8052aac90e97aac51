Durban - THE national undertakers’ strike enters its last day on Wednesday with a glimmer of hope in KwaZulu-Natal. KZN Undertakers’ Forum vice-chairperson Ahmed Paruk said they had received positive feedback from authorities since embarking on the strike. “We have had a very fruitful two days. We went on a fully fledged campaign on this, and the government listened to us. We are busy finalising a meeting with the Department of Health on Thursday (tomorrow),” he said. Paruk said the strike would continue Wednesday as planned, adding that he did not envision it going beyond the three days proposed. “We do not want to inconvenience all the grieving families waiting for bodies at mortuaries and hospitals. They want to bury their loved ones. I think it is only right that we stick to the three days that we had said, and not extend it. But we will have to look at it after we meet the government, and we will make our next move from there,” he said. The three-day national strike resulted in bodies not being collected by these service providers from homes and private and public hospitals. Among other issues, the Unification Task Team (UTT) demanded the abolishment of the tender system in the funeral industry, and grants to be provided to assist emerging small businesses. Clare Estate Crematorium spokesperson Satish Dhupelia said management had met and noted that undertakers had not booked their facility for Monday, yesterday and today. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said there were no reports of violence and intimidation related to the undertakers’ strike. Daily News
