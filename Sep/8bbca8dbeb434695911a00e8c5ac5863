Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident on Friday. “The incident occurred on 24 September 2020 at 07:30; two males in their 30s were found dead near the Station Road in Canelands. They had multiple gunshot wounds to the bodies,” said Mbele, adding that a case of two counts of murder had been opened at the Verulam police station. The two victims were not related, but shared living accommodation. The incident was first reported by members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), a local security company operating with the Durban metropolitan area. “The bullet riddled bodies of two men were discovered outside their home in Canelands, Verulam this morning (Thursday),” RUSA’s Prem Balaram said in a statement dated Thursday. According to Balaram, RUSA received a call in the early hours from a man who said two people had been shot at an informal settlement on Station Road. “On arrival both men were found lying outside their informal home. They had been shot multiple times and died at the scene. Eleven spent 9mm cartridges were recovered in the vicinity of the bodies,” Balaram said. One of the cartridges was found inside the two victims' home and blood was also discovered on a bed. Balaram further told the African News Agency on Friday that residents in the settlement who were questioned about the incident claimed to have seen or heard nothing, despite eleven gunshots being fired. “That’s generally how it works, they don't give up information because they are scared for their lives. In any of the townships we go to, that's how it works,” he added. - African News Agency (ANA)
