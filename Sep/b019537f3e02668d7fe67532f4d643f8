Durban - It is unclear if a 34-year-old man, who allegedly ran off with his teenage neighbour yesterday, will face any charges. Police confirmed that despite news of the incident going viral yesterday, no charges had been opened at any of their stations. Yesterday, social media was abuzz after reports claimed that the married man and father of four, had run off with his 13-year-old neighbour. According to Reaction Unit SA spokesperson, Prem Balram, the pair were allegedly spotted getting into Avanza by a relative. Balram said the girl's family approached RUSA after noticing that their daughter was missing. Her clothing had been taken too. "They approached the home of the neighbour and his wife said her husband's clothing was also missing. A relative said she saw them driving off,  he said. Balram said the two were tracked to a house in Richards Bay close to midnight last night. He said the two were in the company of the man's family. "He said that he had left his home to spend the girl's birthday with his family after she complained of verbal abuse by her parents. It was her birthday and he intended to spoil her and look for work in the area," Balram said. He said Reaction Unit officers transported the Grade 7 girl and her neighbour back to Durban. Despite the widespread concern, provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said:  "Weâ€™ve checked with Richards Bay and Verulam SAPS, no such incident was reported." The Mercury
