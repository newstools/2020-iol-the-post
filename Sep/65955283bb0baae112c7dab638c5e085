Durban - POLICE have had their hands full rescuing and recovering foetuses in KwaZulu-Natal over the past week. On Saturday, police officers from Pietermaritzburg and K9 Search and Rescue units were called out to Mafakathini, to rescue a newborn in a pit latrine. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the newborn was found by a relative in the pit latrine. “The baby was rescued from the pit latrine. Officers clamped the umbilical cord (as the mother had cut it off with a pair of scissors during the birth),” said Mbele. She said the baby and the mother were taken to Northdale Hospital. Taylors Halt police will investigate the incident. Meanwhile, early last week, officers from Pietermaritzburg and K9 Search and Rescue units were called to assist in the recovery of a foetus which had been dumped in the Umkomaas River. A police inquest was opened. On the same day in Eshowe, police saved a week-old baby girl who had been abandoned under a tree next to a garage. A police officer took the baby to Eshowe Hospital.
