Thulasizwe Nkomo Durban - THE South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) in KwaZulu-Natal has warned its beneficiaries to beware of a social grant card swopping scam. Sassa said it distanced itself from reports that have been circulating on social media, where people posed as agency officials saying they could swop beneficiaries’ social grant cards so they could receive food vouchers. The agency said the scam artists had been targeting beneficiaries in the Mafunze area, in Pietermaritzburg. They were visiting beneficiaries in their homes and claiming they would swop their cards and that they would get food vouchers. However, the scam artists would then give the victim a fake card. KwaZulu-Natal Sassa spokesperson Sandy Godlwana urged beneficiaries to be on high alert and not fall prey to the scam. “Sassa is not currently issuing food vouchers and is not planning to embark on a card swop drive. Changing of cards and PIN resets can only be done at Sassa and South African Post Offices. Under no circumstances will Sassa visit households to swop cards,” said Godlwana. Godlwana said they have not yet received any direct complaints from victims but were aware that some beneficiaries had been robbed. “There are some people who have not received their payments because their cards were taken, so we have arranged for those who have been scammed to make an affidavit confirming their story and then visit our offices to receive manual payments,” she said. Godlwana said Sassa staff were not doing household visits during the lockdown. KZN Sassa regional executive manager Themba Matlou appealed to the public to be vigilant and call or visit their nearest Sassa offices or report to the nearest police station if they were suspicious of any activity related to their cards.
