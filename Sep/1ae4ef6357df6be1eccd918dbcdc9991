Durban – A MOTHER of three, accused of dumping her baby in a drain, has been sentenced to three years in prison. At the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Friday, Magistrate Erenskia la Grange noted that the evidence against the woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor children, was “overwhelming”. It took four hours to get the newborn baby girl out of the stormwater drain in February last year. “If it was not for this rescue effort, the child might have died,” said La Grange. The Daily News had reported on the incident at the time and how there were mixed feelings of joy at the child’s life being saved and anger because she was dumped in a drain. It had caused a national outrage. The magistrate said the woman, who had two other older children, should have known the baby could have died. She was not a threat to society, but there were aggravating circumstances and she needed to be punished. During arguments for sentencing, Regional Court prosecutor Kaystree Ramsamujh said the baby had to be protected from the person who was supposed to be nurturing and protecting the child. She deliberately exposed it and if not for the Samaritan, alerted by the baby’s cries, the consequences could have been fatal. The woman could have used adoption or taken the child to a welfare centre. Defence attorney Jacques Botha had argued his client had been overwhelmed by circumstances. The baby is now in the care of a children’s home. Daily News
