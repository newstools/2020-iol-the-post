Durban - It appears that KwaZulu-Natal police are cracking the whip on dagga. In two nights they have recovered dagga worth R5.5 million in two separate drug busts. The latest bust was on Wednesday afternoon in Louwsburg, northern KZN, where Louwsburg police arrested a 40-year-old man for dagga possession. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the man was expected to appear at the Louwsburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday for dagga possession. Gwala said police were conducting stop and search operations along the R69 Road in Louwsburg when they pulled over a minibus taxi. “Upon searching the vehicle, the police discovered 58 bags of dagga loaded inside the taxi and in-between the seats. Upon questioning the driver, it was established that the dagga originates from Bergville and was being transported to a neighbouring country. The recovered dagga is estimated to be valued at R2.5 million,” said Gwala. KZN Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula said the arrest was evident that they were closing in on all nets on drug peddlers. “Police officers in the province will continue with these operations to combat the smuggling of drugs and other contraband,” said Jula. Meanwhile, on Tuesday night, police arrested a man who was transporting R2 million worth of dagga in the Vryheid area. The man was arrested when a multidisciplinary team acted on information about a vehicle transporting dagga from Paulpietersburg towards Vryheid. Police spotted the vehicle and a chase ensued until the vehicle was intercepted. Upon searching the vehicle, 11 bags containing dagga weighing 705kg were found. The 39-year-old driver was placed under arrest for possession of dagga. The estimated street value of the confiscated dagga is R2 million. Daily News
