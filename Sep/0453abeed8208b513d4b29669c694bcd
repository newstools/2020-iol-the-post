Durban - eThekwini Municipality has promised to investigate allegations of sabotage across the city which has left scores of residents without water for days on end. Two Morningside residents have come forward claiming that they have been without water for weeks after people, dressed in municipal uniforms, cut water pipes. Residents in Westville and Durban North have also reported that their meters were cut. The woman said a few houses in the Essenwood area have had their water meters vandalised. "We have had no water since last week Wednesday. We have made calls to the city to complain about it and have informed the ward councillor," she said. Another resident said she runs a nursery school in Morningside and has spent hundreds of rands buying bottled water.  "We have been sabotaged or vandalised during the night. A whole host of us had our water meters cut. Like as in cut in half," the woman said. She said she had to ask her neighbours for pool water to flush the toilets.   According to ward councillor Ernest Smith, there has been a sudden spurt of crime regarding the vandalism of water meters in and around Morningside. "So far, Problem Mkhize (Cowey) Road, Esselemont Avenue, Montpelier Road and Lambert Road were affected. If residents have experienced something similar, please contact me.  Should you have any details such as number plate, vehicle or footage of the suspects doing this please contact me so action can be taken against them," he said. Spokesperson for eThekwini Municipality, Msawakhe Mayisela, said they were unaware of the incidents. "But now that it has been brought to our attention, the City will move with speed to address these issues. We will investigate. The distraction of municipal or private property is a crime and should also be reported to the SAPS. We continue to encourage residents to report these incidents to the City," Mayisela said.
