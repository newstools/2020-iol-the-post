A national shutdown of funeral parlour services went ahead across the province this morning with several reports of intimidation without physical violence, resulting in the closure of businesses across towns and cities. Protesters in solidarity with the Unification Task Team, a group that represents funeral directors, marched with an empty coffin to the Gale Street Mortuary in Durban where they toyi-toyied on the pavement. One of the protestors was seen in a video posted on social media, climbing into the empty coffin outside the facility.

UTT announced the national strike as it wants the government to recognise its estimated R4 billion contribution to the economy and to meet several demands including: National Funeral Directors Association of Southern Africa (NFDASA) president Manesh Govender said his organisation agreed with some concerns that UTT raised but distanced itself from the strike. EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the city recognised the right to strike but it would not condone lawlessness, such as the blocking of traffic and damage to property.
