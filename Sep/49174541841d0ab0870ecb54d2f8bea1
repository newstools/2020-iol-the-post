Durban - A MAN died after he was run over by another vehicle when he got out of his car after it crashed into a bridge on Saturday afternoon. The man was one of eight people who died on KwaZulu-Natal’s roads since Heritage Day. Scores were also left injured. Life Response 24/7 operations manager Leon Fourie said their paramedics were dispatched to a crash on the N2 northbound under the M41 bridge. “On arrival paramedics found a single vehicle that collided with the bridge. The driver of the vehicle got out after the accident and was knocked over by a passing vehicle,” said Fourie. Paramedics had said that because of the seriousness of his injuries, he was dead before they arrived. However, the passenger sustained moderate injuries and was treated on scene before being taken to hospital. Earlier, Midlands EMS Howick Crews were dispatched to a single vehicle crash in Merrivale where a motorist had crashed the vehicle into a tree. Two passengers trapped inside died. The driver was not found at the scene. On Friday, three people died in two crashes, one in Hammarsdale and the other in the Durban city centre. On Heritage Day, in the Essenwood Road area, a pedestrian was killed when three vehicles crashed into each other. One of the vehicles had veered to the side and struck the pedestrian. The pedestrian died before paramedics arrived. Earlier, an 8-year-old died in a single vehicle crash on the N3 just before Balgowan, between Mooi River and Howick. Daily News
