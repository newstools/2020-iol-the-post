Durban - eThekwini Municipality residents’ excessively high water bills are among the list of things organisation Right2Know Campaign (R2K) wants addressed after today’s picket outside the Durban City Hall. KwaZulu-Natal co-ordinator Burton Jaganathan said that since the introduction by the municipality of the Estimation Principle residents have been receiving higher-than-normal bills. He said the picket was also to highlight International Right to Know Day. The peaceful picket will be one of three, with the other two being held in other provinces. Jaganathan said they believed that in eThekwini there was a clear attempt to shield those implicated in corruption cases because of party politics. “We strongly condemn any attempt to hide the misuse of state funds from the public and reject any attempt to prevent the public from knowing how the municipality is spending the community’s money,” he said. Jaganathan said the day was aimed at increasing public awareness of the fundamental human right to information and to pressure governments to make this right a reality. He said the organisation was also demanding an update on the reported cases of corruption in eThekwini relating to the alleged looting of food parcels by councillors meant for communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The auditor-general’s report highlighted R2.34 billion worth of unauthorised, irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure during the financial year ending June 2019. What remedial action has been taken against those implicated? The R2 million for VIP security formal wear, was it approved? We call on municipal staff and officials to show their commitment to the citizens of South Africa and reject corruption by reporting all cases of fraud and corruption because failure to report is tantamount to corruption and defeating the ends of justice.” Daily News
