OPINION – In the past week, you either sided with eNCA news anchor Shahan Ramkissoon or KwaZulu-Natal public servant and prolific writer Kiru Naidoo. The drama had its origins in an interview Ramkissoon did with KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala. Whether rightly or wrongly, Zikalala felt disrespected and belittled. It prompted Naidoo to pen an opinion piece, published in The Mercury, apologising to Zikalala for the pain Ramkissoon had caused. Ramkissoon responded that he had nothing to apologise for – he was merely doing his job. And so, the battle lines in the mainstream media and on social media were drawn. Anyone who has been involved in a physical fight will tell you the rules are simple – there are no rules. Do whatever you need to do to knock out your opponent. But when you choose to argue a point, the approach needs to be more refined. By all means, argue the facts. But don’t get personal. In this case it didn’t happen. Personal insults were thrown by people on both sides of the divide. Soon, the conversation degenerated into a contest on who could humiliate and belittle the best. If the incident taught us anything, it was that we need to reflect on what we say and how we say it. This holds true for Ramkissoon. This holds true for Naidoo. And it holds true for many of those who got involved. POST
