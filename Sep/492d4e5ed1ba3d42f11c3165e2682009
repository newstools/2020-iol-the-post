Kevin Govender THE best years of my life (1993 to 2008) were spent at the seaside town of Isipingo Beach, where I resided in a flat overlooking the ocean. I had a host of friends, including many Muslim brothers, and was well-known in social circles for my swashbuckling profligacy and hedonistic pursuits. But now my memories are being shattered. A resident has won a court ruling calling for an end to the daily (morning and evening) Muslim call to prayer. The mosque and the madrasa are in Inner Circuit Road. Does this particular individual have the requisite to put such a sensitive and delicate case before the judiciary? I know he has the constitutional right to do so. And, worse still, has the judge been per inuriam (without due reference to other laws or judgments) in sanctioning such an order without wider deliberation? For decades the different religions have lived side by side in Isipingo Beach. There has been religious tolerance and harmony. We Christians (to my knowledge) were not stopped from building our churches. Hindus and blacks, for years, have conducted sacrificial prayers on the beach. Zionists have conducted baptisms in the holy waters. Hindus disperse of ashes of their cremated loved ones in the sea. Yearly, hundreds of Hindu worshippers, who come to the Easter Festival in Isipingo Rail, flock to Isipingo Beach. But again, to my knowledge, there has been no unreasonable objection from Muslims to this freedom of religious practices. Where does this man, who is attacking and mocking another religion, rise from? Surely he has not resided in the area all his life? I feel compelled to join my Muslim brothers in their appeal against the ruling. Such impediments to religious freedom have been unheard of in our modern society. KEVIN GOVENDER Shallcross POST
