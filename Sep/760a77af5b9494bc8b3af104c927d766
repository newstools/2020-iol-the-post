Durban - Five Newlands East Secondary School girls who were suspended in February over a bullying incident captured on cellphone footage have been expelled. The incident occured on February 11 and appears to take place in what looks like the school toilet. The pupils were placed on suspension on February, 20 and an investigation conducted by the School Governing Body (SGB) recommended that the girls should be expelled from the school. The five girls were captured on video attacking a defenceless grade 10 pupil. The gruesome incident was allegedly filmed by other pupils during the incident, and went viral on social media and sparked outcry about bullying and safety at schools.. The Department of Education said that the Head of Department Dr Enock Vusumuzi Nzama had applied his mind to the recommendations and agreed with the recommendations made by the SGB to suspend the five girls from the school. The expulsion letters from the head of department have been sent to the district office to implement the expulsions. “As the department, we want to send a very strong message of warning to any pupil that involves herself or himself in any form of bullying that they will be dealt with harshly”. This week the Department suspended two pupils from a Zululand school who were allegedly involved in the attack of another pupil. One of the girls was captured on a video that went viral on social media assaulting another girl and pulling her panties until they snapped. Daily News
