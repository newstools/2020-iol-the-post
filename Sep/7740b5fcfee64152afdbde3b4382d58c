Durban - THE electrification of the Bottlebrush Informal Settlement in Shallcross will resume after a short supply of meter boxes. The project started in June 2019, with the erection of main cables and transformer boxes along Link Road. ANC Ward 71 branch chairperson Vikelo Masebenza said the project was interrupted in January because of the shortage. On Friday, stock arrived. Masebenza said the contractors will double their efforts from today to cover time lost. The settlement, located between Chatsworth and Shallcross, has been an eyesore with a spiderweb of illegal connections. Ward 71 councillor Previn Vedan said there were about 6000 shacks and close to 20000 people living in the settlement. “The aim of the programme is to remove illegal electricity connections and provide the informal community with prepaid electricity meters. We have divided the area into six phases. Two phases have received the meter boxes and are on the grid. Others want to pay for services but have been ignored. An average of five children die each year when they come into contact with exposed electricity cables from illegal connections,” Vedan said. Bottlebrush resident Nokuphuka Mashakene said her grandchildren would now be safe. Another resident Themba Chiliza said he was always concerned about power surges associated with illegal connections. “It gives me peace of mind. I am using about R300 per month on electricity. I hope I would receive a house in the future,” Chiliza said. Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said in an attempt to reduce illegal connections and improve living conditions, a decision was taken to electrify informal dwellings. “The informal placement makes it difficult to gain access and lay out electrical infrastructure. Despite the challenges, we are committed to driving the electrification programme forward,” he said. Daily News
