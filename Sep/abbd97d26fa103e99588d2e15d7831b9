Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Anti-Gang Unit have pounced on a policeman stationed at Wentworth who they allege is involved in a series of gang-related shootings in the area. The unit swooped on the Wentworth police station just after 9am on Friday where they arrested Warrant Officer Brian James. James, who investigators believe is linked to the notorious Cartel gang in Wentworth, was whisked away in front of his shocked colleagues and taken to the Durban Magistrate’s Court, where he was charged with conspiracy to commit murder. He was denied bail and the case against him was remanded until September 23. According to police sources close to the investigation, James is linked to gang members arrested earlier this month by the Provincial Anti-Gang Unit, Provincial Organised Crime Unit together and Crime Intelligence. Jasmin Simon, known as Moni, Kyle Pretorius, known as Para and Tyrel Martin, Chad Marais, Mthandeni Masilva Khoza and Trese Pretorious, known as Mini, appeared at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on charges of conspiracy to commit murder. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src="https://rumble.com/embedJS/uqnnu"+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+"/?url="+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+"&args="+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, "script", "Rumble");  They are based out of “barracks” in Wentworth and were arrested at different times.
