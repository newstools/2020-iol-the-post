Durban - UMHLATHUZE Municipality has put in place a by-law to stop the scourge of public drinking, an ongoing issue for the municipality. The proposal comes as the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed South Africa’s problematic relationship with alcohol. Municipality spokesperson Mdu Ncalane said: “We have been having a problem, as a municipality. We have been hamstrung by a lack of jurisdiction.” The proposed by-law, which falls under the “City of uMhlathuze Roads and Safety by-laws”, states that people are not allowed to drink in any public road, street, public parking area or any premises. Ncalane said they created the by-law to empower themselves to tackle the problem. “We have a problem with people drinking in public places, which ended up making the municipality and surrounding townships filthy.” They wanted the public to provide feedback on the bylaw, with September 30 the cut-off to make contributions. He said it would take three to four months for the by-law to be gazetted, and that it would come into effect by the end of January next year at the latest. To give an example of the effects of drinking in public, Ncalane cited Naval Island, in Richards Bay, as a place that had to be shut down due to a number of incidents. He said the island, which is owned and controlled by Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA), had seen cases of violence and suicides. Earlier this year, it was reported TNPA decided to close the island in December. Port manager Thami Sithole said they took the decision after “security challenges that have not only disrupted port operations to the detriment of the economy, but have also resulted in several deaths and injuries at the site”. The place also had loud parties, and TNPA took the decision after consulting with uMhlathuze Municipality. Daily News
