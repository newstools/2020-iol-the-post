Durban - AN EMPANGENI doctor who has been on the run for two years for fraud and whose investigation led to the death of a government official was expected to appear in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Monday. He was arrested on Friday by the Durban Serious Corruption Investigation unit. The 51-year-old doctor was accused of processing fraudulent disability grants between 2005 and 2008 at Ngwelezane in Empangeni, said Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI-Hawks) spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo. Mhlongo said the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) had deployed its district manager, Thembinkosi Gobza Dlamini, 36, to investigate the matter. Dlamini was then shot dead in June 2008 in his Ngwelezane office six days after commencing the internal investigation. Six suspects were arrested by the Durban Organised Crime Unit for Dlamini’s murder. They were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in Mtunzini High Court in June 2013. They also received an additional six years for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the Hawks became interested after the sentencing in 2013 and launched an investigation into the alleged fraud and corruption in the department. The Hawks and Empangeni Crime Prevention Unit arrested five Sassa officials, a doctor and the runner. “It is alleged that the seven conspired and defrauded Sassa of about R25 million between 2005 and 2008 through fraudulent grants. Three of the seven accused are also accused of having allegedly participated in the murder of Dlamini,” he said. Mulaudzi said the matter was still under investigation. The accused are appearing in the Empangeni Magistrate’s Court. Daily News
