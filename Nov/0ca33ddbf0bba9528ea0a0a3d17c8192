Durban - Scores of people spilled out onto Marine Drive on Tuesday to pay their last respects to alleged drug kingpin, Simone Jasmin who was assassinated last Thursday. Known as Queen of the South to the Wentworth community - because of her life’s striking similarities to the main character in the Mexican telenovela - Jasmin’s funeral service was held at a church on the Bluff, not far from where she lived. The funeral procession which included a white winged hearse that carried her white coffin followed by several white Land Rover 4X4’s began at her home on Marine Drive. While only 100 people were allowed in the church, scores of people lined the streets as the funeral hearse, preceded by the sound of Scottish bagpipes snaked its away along the street at her home.  Dozens of police officers from watched proceedings. Jasmine, who is said to be the head of the notorious Cartel gang - that has been linked to a series of shootings and murders in Wentworth - was killed on Thursday by assassins who had been staking out her house in Marine Drive. Minutes after getting into an e-hailing cab an assassin pulled up next to her and shot her at least six times at close range. Two bullets struck her chest, three in her stomach and one in her leg. The e-hailing driver fled when the gunman struck but came back after and drove Jasmin to a hospital where she declared dead. Police have launched an investigation into her murder. No one has been arrested yet. Daily News
