Durban - A Merebank father claims his heroics saved his son’s life after a man shot him at close range. Donovan Naidoo, 54, said his son Rishay Maharaj, 24, is in a stable condition in hospital after being shot three times during an altercation outside his home in Nasik Road on Saturday night. Naidoo said he was sitting with a group of friends and Maharaj outside his home when a car stopped next to them. Three occupants got out and asked them why they were “bumping”, a slang word for inciting trouble. The men, known to Naidoo, then began a verbal tirade. One of the allegations was that Maharaj had earlier came to their flat in Merebank and instigated an argument. Naidoo tried to explain that his son was not a troublemaker. By then Naidoo’s daughter, his wife and grandchildren came to the road- side to see what the commotion was about. “They surrounded myself and Maharaj. Maharaj tried to speak with one of the men. Suddenly the shooter drew his gun and let off three shots. I grabbed him and twisted his arm. I tried to disarm him but he continued to shoot in the direction of my family. He eventually pulled away. I think a second person also shot at us. The bullets struck one of my cars,” Naidoo said. He said Maharaj turned to him and said, “Dad, I am shot in the arm”. “I saw his shirt soaking up with blood. We rushed him to the hospital. If I had not taken evasive action Rishay would have been dead,” he said. Maharaj was shot twice in the chest and once in the arm. KZN police Captain Nqobile Gwala said Wentworth SAPS is investigating a case of attempted murder. “It is alleged on Saturday at 20:25, a 24-year-old man was shot and wounded by known suspects while at his home on Nasik Road in Merebank. The suspects fled the scene after incident. The vehicle was later found in the Merebank area with no suspects inside. The suspects are still being sought by police.” Daily News
