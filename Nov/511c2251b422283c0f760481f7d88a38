Durban - A PRIVATE investigator has been roped in to find the person who shot an endangered crowned eagle with a pellet gun in Malvern in July. The juvenile female eagle was rescued by wildlife volunteers from the roof of a home in Hillside Avenue. A resident had seen it fall from the sky. The Centre for Rehabilitation of Wildlife (Crow) had to euthanise the eagle after a few days of treatment. A pellet had severed her spinal cord. Two other pellets, believed to be old wounds, were found in the eagle. Crow director Clint Halkkett-Siddall said this week that Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and private investigator Brad Nathanson were on the case. He said R24 000 has been raised for the reward and a further R11 500 towards any legal costs or investigation costs that might be incurred. “We do have information that has come in via the public which has led us to a suspect. Unfortunately, there is no physical evidence at the moment. The reward is still in play for anybody who can provide us with evidence or a witness that is able to sign an affidavit or anything such as WhatsApp messages that admit to this crime,” Halkkett-Siddall said. He thanked all those who were conservation-minded and had “stepped up to the plate” for their passion and interest in the case. “This case has shown us how some people will go over and above for nature while other people can be so cruel.” Crowned eagles are “Tops” – threatened or protected species. The death of the eagle has sent shock waves through KwaZulu-Natal. A sponsor, Compass Medical Waste director Ian du Randt, urged the perpetrator to do “the honourable thing and go to the authorities”. Daily News
