Durban - A police officer and three people were arrested after a video circulated on social media of what appeared to be a drunk Ethekwini Water and Sanitation employee urinating next to a police vehicle. Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said police were informed of the disorderly conduct of occupants of the vehicle. “Police at Amanzimtoti responded and arrested a police officer and three civilians who were charged for drunk and disorderly conduct,” said Naicker. “Police management will be contemplating further criminal charges against the police officer while an internal disciplinary investigation will also be initiated.” It is alleged that the incident took place outside a mall or shopping centre in eManzimtoti, south of Durban, on Sunday night. In the video, a woman standing next to an open back door of a KwaMakhutha SAPS vehicle. She pulls down her pants and underwear and urinates. The woman is dressed in blue - the blue work pants with a reflector strip below the knee on both legs and a blue T-shirt with EWS written in white on the back. When she is done, she pulls up her underwear and pants and gets into the vehicle and closes the door. The vehicle also has a broken and taped up window on the passenger side behind the driver and the side where the woman was urinating, half the vehicle did not have SAPS branding. In the background, the person who took the video can be heard saying the woman was urinating another says she worked at Durban waste because of the letters on the back of her T-shirt. Questions and a copy of the video were sent to the eThekwini Municipality to comment on the incident but the municipality had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
