Durban - SABOTAGE is alleged to be behind the removal of by-election posters in wards 32 (Clairwood) and 36 (Durban North). The by-elections take place on November 11. DA ward 36 councillor candidate Shontel de Boer believed the ANC could be behind the removal of her campaign posters. However, the ANC said some of their posters were also removed from wards 32 and 36. As a result, they have opened a case at Brighton Beach SAPS. At the weekend, De Boer shared on Facebook a photograph of her poster at the bottom of a street light pole with two ANC posters above it. Her caption read: “This is how disrespectful the ANC are in ward 36. I’m not angry, I’ll let God deal with them.” De Boer told the Daily News that she noticed that as the ANC posters were erected, her posters “suddenly disappeared” or were or lying on the ground. “I’ve picked up one outside Northwood Boys’ High School and another on Kensington Drive. “We haven’t covered every single pole on the roads, we’ve just chosen poles we thought are good for motorists to see. In between that there are gaps so there’s plenty of space for other parties to put up their posters.” De Boer said they would be raising the matter with the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) but felt nothing would be done as this was not the first time it had happened. While not surprised, De Boer said she was disappointed because they put hard work into the posters and spent a lot of money only to find they had disappeared or were on the ground. Questioned about De Boer’s allegations, Zenzele Thabede, the ANC’s head of elections in eThekwini, said: “It looks like we have the same problem. We have even opened a case.” He said two of their wards were badly affected, ward 36 and 32. “There’s an area where all of them were removed.” He said it was upsetting because it affected their campaign and resources. Destroying, removing or defacing other parties’ posters is prohibited in terms of the Electoral Act. Daily News
