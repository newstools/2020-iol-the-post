Durban - Residents living in areas in the south of Durban are urged to brace for an interruption in their water supply for at least two days this week. In a statement, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, said the city's Water and Sanitation Unit would undertake a planned shutdown of the South Coast Augmentation pipeline to replace a faulty scour valve and a leaking air valve on the 800mm diameter steel trunk main, supplying Amanzimtoti Water Works. He said the process would commence on Tuesday (November 10) from 5pm until Wednesday (November 11) at 6am. "During this process, there will be zero incoming flow, and thus downstream areas including eThekwini reservoirs and Amanzimtoti Water Works will have limited system input volume," he said. The following areas might experience poor pressure or no water towards the later times of the shutdown period, amid the construction: eManzimtoti CBD Isipingo Athlone Park Doonside Warner Beach Winklespruit Karridene KwaMakhutha Most parts of Adams Mission Ezimbokodweni Lewis Dr area Malabar Hills Lotus Park Garden lots Almond Road Bhekulwandle Umnini Magabheni Danganya Craigieburn eMkhomazi Clansthal Naidoville Willow Glen Midnight Café Crowder Ehlanzeni Mgobhozini Illovu Lovu Beach Mfume Mashiwane Egudwini Nkwali Kingsburgh Panorama Park Umgababa KwaFakazi KwaMgendwa Mahlathini Ohlongeni Ekuphileni Amahlongwa Amalundi For more information and enquiries regarding water supply, residents are urged to contact Call Centre number 080 131 3013 or the EWS WhatsApp number 073 1483 477.
