Durban - RAJESH Sukwa came face-to-face with his son's alleged killers during an identity parade at Tongaat police station on Tuesday. His son, Ashveer Sukwa, was stabbed 35 times during a robbery at their home in Fairbreeze, Tongaat, earlier this month. Sukwa's body was found wrapped in a sheet and blanket on his bedroom floor. The 35-year-old died at the scene. Rajesh, 67, was stabbed several times and locked in a cold room in a warehouse on their residential property. Sukwa ran a fresh produce distribution business with his father. The suspects ransacked the home, fleeing with cash and other items. They were arrested soon after the incident. Three suspects, one of whom was Sukwa's employee, was arrested and charged with murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. A fourth suspect, a 16-year-old boy, was also arrested and faced the same charges. He was released into his guardian's custody. Raksha Sookdhoo, a relative, said Rajesh wanted justice. "He held his composure throughout the identity parade. He wants those responsible for his son's death to be put behind bars. It has been a difficult few weeks. He was just discharged from hospital after undergoing surgery to his lower back but he is ready to work with the police to get justice." Sookdhoo said she and other family were living with him. "We don't want to leave him alone. He has not yet decided if he wants to leave the home, which is flooded with memories of Ashveer. His father kept all his things, even his childhood toys." The suspects will appear in court again on Wednesday. POST
