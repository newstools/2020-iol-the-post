In a separate incident in July 2019, an Amanzimtoti man’s right hand was severed in a freak accident. Derrick Bank spokesperson from EMS Midlands said the 44-year-old Malawian lost his right hand while building a dog kennel. "It is believed the patient was cutting wood with a electric saw to make a dog kennel when the incident occurred," said Banks. He said it is unclear about events leading up to the accident but confirmed that police were on scene. "The paramedics placed a tourniquet around the arm before they removed the towel to see the injury. The hand was completed severed. Paramedics covered the wound and kept pressure to avoid any more blood loss,“ said Banks. IOL
