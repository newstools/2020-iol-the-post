Durban – Disaster management teams across KwaZulu-Natal have been placed on high alert following a weather warning of severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the province later on Monday. The South African Weather Service Severe says thunderstorms are expected over the south-western parts and the Midlands this afternoon, drifting into the north-eastern parts in the evening. KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Sipho Hlomuka warned residents of the dangers posed by the severe thunderstorms which are expected to bring strong winds, hail and heavy downpours.
