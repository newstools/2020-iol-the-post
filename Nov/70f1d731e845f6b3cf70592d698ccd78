Durban - Four suspects have been nabbed for allegedly robbing a supermarket and subsequently shooting an RTI officer at a roadblock while fleeing. According to police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, it is alleged that on Monday around 10:15am, a group of armed men entered a supermarket in Bulwer and demanded cash. She said they stole an undisclosed amount of cash and robbed a customer. “Two security guards were robbed of their firearms before the suspects fled in their getaway vehicles. “Whilst fleeing, RTI officers had a roadblock and gunshots were fired towards them when they tried to stop the vehicles, injuring one officer.” Mbele said the officer, aged 29, was taken to hospital for treatment. She said a case of robbery and attempted murder was opened at Bulwer police station. Mbele said police responded swiftly, which led them to the arrests of three suspects in the Sweetwaters area.
