She was like any other 13-year-old in Grade 8. This case will be used by others in court in future to defend themselves. This decision promotes violence by youngsters against the elderly,” he said. The woman was murdered in her home after she was left alone with her two-year-old grandchild and her teen granddaughter. Daily News
