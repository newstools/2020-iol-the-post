Durban- The University of KwaZulu-Natal welcomed the efforts of law enforcement after two suspects were arrested in connection with an arson attack on the Oval student residence at the Westville Campus last month. Acting University of KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Normah Zondo said: “The two suspects were arrested on Tuesday, 3 November when Westville police conducted a sting operation in one of the residences in Durban city centre.  Both suspects will appear in Pinetown court on Wednesday, November 4, 2020. This brings to four the number of suspects arrested in this matter. Investigators are still searching for two more suspects believed to be involved in the arson attack.The University is yet to confirm if the suspects are registered students or not.” Zondo said investigators said two unregistered students would be facing trespassing, arson and attempted murder charges. She said the arrests should sound warning bells to criminals masquerading as students on their campuses. She said these people did not have a place in UKZN and South African society and condemned the act. “The University calls on anyone with information to come forward by contacting the University’s Risk Management Services (RMS) to assist with our ongoing investigation,” Zondo said. The burning of the student residence was one of many that have happened over the past few years. In February this year, the Risk Management Services building was burned during protests that erupted at the university over numerous issues which included historical debt. This led to the academic programme being suspended at the institution. Last year a protest resulted in a guardhouse being burned down by protesters at How College campus. Daily News
