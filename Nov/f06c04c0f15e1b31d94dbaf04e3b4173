 Every year between October and November, millions of people across the world come together for a spiritual celebration of the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. This year, some of South Africa’s most loved culinary solutions, NESTLÉ FULL CREAM SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK, NESTLÉ COCOA and NESTLÉ KLIM join in the five-day celebrations to commemorate the festival of lights which takes place on 14 November 2020. Through the #DelightfullyMzansi campaign, the three iconic brands have come together to link food and culture in celebrating this year’s Diwali festivities. The Diwali Festival is not just about lights but a period where families and friends exchange gifts, sweets and celebrate the occasion through food, music and embracing cultural diversity. “We all know that delighting family and friends is one of the key elements of Diwali as food brings people together. Our brands: NESTLÉ FULL CREAM SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK, NESTLÉ COCOA and NESTLÉ KLIM offer the much-needed ingredients you need to create the delicious treats you like throughout the celebration. The Diwali Festival is one of our passion points and we look forward to celebrating this year's occasion with our Diwali consumers across the country," says Yovini Moodley, Business Executive Officer, Dairy, Nestlé South Africa.
