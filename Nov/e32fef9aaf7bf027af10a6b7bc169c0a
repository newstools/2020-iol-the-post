According to KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, Durban North SAPS, assisted by a private security company, embarked on a special operation on the corner of Umhlanga Rocks Drive and Margaret Maytom Avenue. “The team acted on information about illegal activities taking place in one of the premises. “Upon arrival at the house, they were met by two occupants and a search was then conducted inside the house. “Upon searching the premises, police uncovered a dagga lab. A total of 400 dagga plants, large quantities of dried cannabis, cannabis oils that were ready for distribution as well as equipment for manufacturing and processing cannabis were seized by police.” Mbele said two suspects - aged 25 and 30 - were also found in possession of an illegal firearm with 28 rounds of ammunition. They were charged with dealing in drugs. In a separate incident, a 26-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Wentworth Magistrate’s Court charged with dealing in drugs and dagga. Wentworth police searched a flat in Weist Road and found the suspect in possession of drugs, the police spokesperson said. “27 packets of cocaine powder, 57 ecstasy tablets, 41 dagga tobacco packets, 20 clear plastic packets containing dagga and a moon of rock cocaine were found. “The total value of the recovered drugs is estimated at R60 000.
