Durban – A baby dressed in a pink outfit and wrapped in a white fleece blanked with different coloured stars was found abandoned in the oThongathi area on Wednesday afternoon. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said they received a call from Big Show Towing for an abandoned baby in the oThongathi area. “On arrival of paramedics, the baby was carried to the ambulance by Ismail from Big Show. It is alleged that a person jogging past, had heard the baby’s cries in the bushy area alongside the road,” said Herbst. He said due to the nature of the call and in consultation with Mediclinic Victoria Hospital management, it was agreed to transport the baby to the private facility for treatment. Herbst said the baby was well dressed and wrapped in a blanket. He thanked Mediclinic Victoria Hospital for assisting in treating the baby. Herbst also said all the necessary authorities were updated on the incident. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said at 6.10pm, a six-week old baby girl was found at Old Crescent near Amanzimnyama Park. The baby was taken to hospital for a medical check-up. “A case of child abandonment was opened at Tongaat police station,” said Gwala. Meanwhile, babies can be safely abandoned by placing them in a baby safe which can be found in various parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Baby safes in the province can be found at Thandi House (Pietermaritzburg), The Domino Foundation (Durban North), Isiaiah 54 Children’s Sanctuary (Bluff), Choices for Life: Impilo Baby Haven (eManzimtoti), Likhon iThemba Charity Hop Shop (Glenwood) and Port Shepstone Baptist Church (Port Shepstone). Plans have been made for more baby safes to be installed in more parts of the province. Daily News
