Durban - About 50 Durban University of Technology students burned mattresses and blockades the entrance to the institutionâ€™s Alpine residence on Monday night in protest over food vouchers. Durban University of Technology Student Representative Council president Njabulo Sangweni said the power at the Alpine residence was problematic and often tripped which caused their food to go bad. "Its trips all the time and when that happens students cant cook and there's no hot water. Last week there was no power because of this and that was resolved. The issue is the vouchers they were promised for their food that had gone bad due to the electricity (going out). That has not be resolved and that's why students resorted to protest action last night," he said. In a video that circulated online, the students gathered in the rain armed with umbrellas demanding that someone at the offices they are at comes out and addresses them. The students chant and sing outside the offices shouting " she must come out" (Akaphume uNtombo). Another student on a loudhailer  shouts "we are hungry we have not eaten, we are losing patience - don't make us angry". Two officials who addressed the students explained that it was only Thursday that discussions around the food vouchers began. They told students that the process was lengthy and would not happen over night and that their R400 vouchers would be given to them. However students said that the voucher amount agreed on had been R500. And their discussion with the dean of students which was played over the loudhailer revealed that as far as he knew students had received vouchers on Monday. The Durban University of Technology was yet to reply to questions sent to it around the protest action last night and this morning's gathering of students. Police spokesperson,  CaptainNqobile Gwala said that the matter was resolved. "No case was opened" Daily News
