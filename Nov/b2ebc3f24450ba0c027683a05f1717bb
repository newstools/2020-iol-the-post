She has two daughters, Denise Reid and Beryl Doepoe, and has seen her family grow over the years. She has eight grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and two great-great grandchildren. Noyle lived in Joburg for 70 years and has been in Durban for the past 30 years. She worked as a typist and has now swopped her active lifestyle with more relaxed activities such as bingo, bowling and visiting the library. Reid expressed joy at having her mother in her life for 80 years. “I am very proud to see that my mother has witnessed so many generations of her family in her lifetime. I also hope that I will also be able to live to see more generations of our family … ” She attributed Noyle’s longevity to an active lifestyle, which included lots of running, sport and regular visits to church. Mike Reid, Noyle’s son-in-law, said: “It’s a real honour to celebrate her birthday. She’s been the most wonderful mother-in-law and a great sportswoman.” Daily News
