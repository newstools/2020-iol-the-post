Durban - The search is still on for a young man believed to be between 19 and 21, who drowned at St Luciaâ€™s Jabula Beach on Sunday afternoon. In a statement, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park said a young man was swimming with his friends when he drowned and disappeared around 3.30pm. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) was called to  search him, but could not recover the body at the time. The park said the search continued early on Monday morning.
