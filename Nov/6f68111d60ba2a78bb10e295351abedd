Durban - The N2 north and southbound carriageways at Chesterville and the N3 eastbound between the Pavilion offramp and the EB Cloete Interchange have been identified as crime hotspots where opportunistic criminals prey on stranded motorists.

"Scenarios are being created causing damage to vehicles and forcing them to come to a stop on busy highways, where potential criminals are lying in wait to strike. More and more incidents are occurring which have been caused by the placing of rocks on key routes and the criminals who do this are wanting to disable vehicles so they can attack and rob the occupants," he said.
