Durban - The festive season just almost upon us and thanks to Covid-19, many people will have to alter their Christmas plans and make merry at home. But while making plans to make memories with loved ones, we need to ensure that we are safe. Head of marketing and communications at ADT, Charnel Hattingh, said it is important to be safe during the festive season. "We all thoroughly deserve the time to relax with our friends and families. If we remember a few basic security measures, we can make a big difference towards enjoying this time of year safely," she said. The first and most important step to take, Hatting said, is to regularly test your alarm to ensure that it is in good working order. "It is also a good idea to let your security company know what your holiday plans are and how best to get in touch with you in the event of an emergency," she advised. Additional security tips for holidaymakers to make sure their residential property is protected and safe: "We also recommend that people be careful and discreet about packing for a long journey and to not give any indication that your home might be unattended for an extended period of time," Hattingh said. She said the key thing to remember is to make sure that everyone in your family is prepared and that they know exactly what to do in a case of an emergency. "It doesnâ€™t matter if you are relaxing at home, at a resort or next to the ocean these holidays. If something were to happen to you or a loved one, make sure you know who to contact for emergency assistance," Hattingh said. IOL
