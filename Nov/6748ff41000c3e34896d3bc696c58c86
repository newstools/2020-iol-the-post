Durban - Hundreds of eThekwini Municipality Durban Solid Waste Workers toyi-toyied for hours outside the city’s water department offices in Springfield Park on Tuesday morning demanding to see the department’s deputy managers. Workers, who declined to be named because they are participating in an illegal strike, said they were protesting about the municipality’s decision to cut their weekend overtime hours and because of "many other issues". The workers, some waving large sticks and dancing, gathered peacefully outside the office under the watchful eye of SAPS officers and metro police who had riot gear. They demanded to see department official Nqaphile Gcwensa. Municipal refuse truck drivers, who parked their trucks along Electron Road, said refuse had not been collected across the city today.  A spokesperson for the SA Municipal Workers Union was not available to comment at the time of publication. EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela advised residents to keep their refuse in their yards until further notice. “This is as a result of an illegal strike by DSW workers,” he said. He said the city had prioritised resolving the matter speedily. The Mercury
