Durban - FOUR days before the 16 Days of Activism of No Violence Against Women and Children campaign begins, two women were killed, in separate incidents, in Durban. On Saturday night, a homeless woman was stabbed several times at the Prince Mhlangana and Chris Hani Road (formerly North Coast Road) intersection. Effingham Community Policing Forum spokesperson Rajiv Jaynath said the woman lived with a group of people under the old North Coast Road bridge. She was often seen begging at strategic points entering Prince Mhlangana and Effingham Road. “From what we heard, she was stabbed multiple times. She was allegedly walking in a disorientated state across the road. Witnesses saw a car allegedly colliding into her. A few other cars drove over her while she lay on the ground,” Jaynath said. Greenwood Park police have opened a case of murder. In Phoenix, a woman was found with a stab wound to her neck, three stab wounds on her stomach and multiple stab wounds on her arms in Central Park. The woman was last seen alive at 10pm on Friday, at the Phoenix Post Office, and was believed to be a sex worker. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that on Saturday morning, the body of Xoliswa Phakathi was found with multiple stab wounds by a resident. Mbele said Phakathi was from the Bhambayi area in Inanda. “A case of murder has been opened at Phoenix SAPS.” GBH security general manager Marlan Naidoo said at about 5.50am, their GBH response officer was patrolling through the Plaza area when he was flagged down by a resident who alerted him to a body lying in Plaza Park. “A female was found dead with a fatal laceration to the neck,” said Naidoo.
