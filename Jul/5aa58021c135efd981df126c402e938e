Durban - Donovan Dillon has been pencilled in as the missing jockey blank on Golden Ducat in Saturday’s Vodacom Durban July. Dillon was officially declared by trainer Eric Sands yesterday after much speculation. With the majority of the July field set to carry 53kg and less, there is a shortage of experienced light-weight riders in KwaZulu-Natal as jockeys are not able to shuttle between provinces. Dillon, whose carded minimum riding weight is 56.5kg, will need to shed 3.5kg by Saturday to make the 53kg allotted the Cape Derby winner, but he was confident he would make the required weight in time. He weighed in at 55kg yesterday. “I’m on a strict diet and I have got a week,” he said on Tuesday. He has also consulted former jockey Garth Puller who famously shed 6kg to make 49kg when winning the July aboard Bush Telegraph in 1987. There has been major interest in this year’s race with lots of money for a number of outsiders. Rainbow Bridge is current tote favourite paying R3.30 for a win with Belgarion second favourite paying R4.30. However, Belgarion is favourite with the bookmakers, on offer at 4-1 with Rainbow Bridge at 9-2. There has been tote money for Vardy, from R9 in to R7.25, while the Mike de Kock-trained Soqrat is R11, in from R13, and Sean Tarry’s Shango is in from R20 to R15. Latest bookmakers’ betting is: 4-1 Belgarion, 9-2 Rainbow Bridge, 8-1 Got The Greenlight, 9-1 Bunker Hunt, Vardy, 11-1 Vardy, 12-1 Do It Again, 13-1 Soqrat, 20-1 Shango, 22-1 Golden Ducat, Twist Of Fate, 40-1 Padre Pio, Miyabi Gold, Tierra Del Fuego, 45-1 Capoeira, 66-1 Divine Odyssey, Silvano’s Pride, It’s My Turn, 100-1 Camphoratus.
