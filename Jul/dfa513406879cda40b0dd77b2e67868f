Durban- Although South Africa has some of the most progressive legislation when it comes to the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Queer community they still faced discrimination when it came to many aspects of their lives. In a study that involved 288 people from all over South Africa, the research by the Inclusive Society Institute made numerous findings. It found that although 86 percent of participants said they were aware of their constitutional rights,less than 59 percent believed that these rights were adequate and needed stronger policies. “A perturbing finding was that 59% of those surveyed still experienced discrimination when wanting to express or participate in their own cultural practices, while a very high 67% felt discriminated against when wanting to express their personal religious beliefs,” the report said. The institute said the respondents felt that the LGBT+ community had received support from family and friends. They said that 86 percent of participants were content with the relationships between family and friends. “The most disturbing finding of the survey relates to health, particularly mental health. Altogether 24% of survey respondents indicated that they were suffering from some form of medical condition. When asked to specify, 41% registered the presence of a mental health condition. Upon delving deeper, mental health issues appear to be a challenge for 53% of respondents in the below-26 age bracket. The Inclusive Society Institute believes that this specific result requires urgent attention, as it could suggest a potential mental health crisis in the making.” Daily News
