Durban - DESPITE being in the throes of the Covid-19 lockdown, two Durban families are living in much better conditions after receiving homes made from converted shipping containers. A group of Durban volunteers began a community-based project to convert about 6.1m storage containers into homes. The containers have windows, a door, and are furnished with beds and tables. Ahmed Osman, the founder of Human Aid SA, said they also provide a home starter kit of a paraffin stove, pots, pans and cutlery. The first container home was delivered to Malacca Road Informal Settlement resident Tholakele Doris Gwala, 58. A fire swept through the settlement in June, claiming the life of her son Sphamandla Khumalo, 30. Gwala lives with her daughter and grandson in her new home. “I am enjoying my new home but the memories of my son’s death still haunt me. The home has given us some comfort. It is like my life has restarted,” she said. Khulekani Gumede received his home on Mandela Day. He lives in the Shintshani community near Verulam. Previously, Gumede lived with his wife and two children in a cramped shack. He was chosen by community leaders because of his plight. Gumede said the home has changed his family’s lifestyle and he was grateful for the support. He had lost his job due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Osman said a bunk bed was put inside to accommodate the children, and Gumede was also provided with a double-bed, a table, chairs and a cupboard, clothes, blankets, pillows, as well as grocery hampers. Osman said he got the idea while travelling abroad. “I had seen Syrian refugees living in these container homes. I thought we could use the idea back home,” he said. Human Aid is run by a group of businessmen, who, together with family, friends and other businesses, have been funding the project. “We are dependent on donors and are registering to become a non-profit organisation,” said Osman.
