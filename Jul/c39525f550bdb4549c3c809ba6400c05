Gift of the Givers chairperson Imtiaz Sooliman laughed when his daughter sent him a fake news social media post on Sunday night with the sad news that he had “passed on”. Sooliman, who has taken the fake news on the chin, said he was sitting at home with his wife at about 9pm when his daughter sent him the poorly worded WhatsApp message, along with her own comment, a smiley face emoji saying “they’re kidding”. He said his daughter had not been disturbed by the message as she lived nearby and knew he had not been sick. “My family never panic about things like that. They were all just laughing about it. It didn’t bother me. I thought to myself that they could have mistaken me for some other guy. “We have a family member in hospital so I thought they had mistaken me for the family member but we didn’t get news from the family member so it was obvious it was not that. “Then I said if anybody did it deliberately it wouldn’t make any sense because they know it’s not true and in 15 to 20 minutes the whole country would know it was not true. It didn’t bother me,” he said. Sooliman said he had responded on social media by sending a video of the Celine Dion song I’m Alive to two social media groups. He said he was quickly inundated with calls and messages of support from people across the country. Sooliman advised people not to share fake news and to always check information claimed in social media messages before forwarding them to friends. The Mercury
