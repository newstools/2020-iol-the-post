 Durban - Parts of the province will be without electricity during peak hours on Thursday while Eskom implements load reductions. In a statement sent on Wednesday, Eskom said the operation will  prevent network overloading caused by illegal connections, vandalised electricity infrastructure and bypassed meters. Overloading of networks leads to damage to the electricity infrastructure through explosions in overloaded transformers and mini-substations. It also poses danger to people and property in the affected communities. Currently, Eskom is battling to keep up with the increased equipment failure that is costing millions to repair. The areas include Dannhauser, Ladysmith and parts of eThekwini as well as Newcastle and uMshwathi. These areas will be without electricity from 7am to 9am, or 5pm to 9pm: Dannhauser (7am - 9am) Banf Fairbreeze Greenock Kilegethe Naas Poona Rutland Emnambithi / Ladysmith (5pm - 7pm) Ezakheni Graythorne eThekwini (7am - 9am) Luthuli Umgababa Umgababa south Msunduzi / Impendle (7am - 9am) Imbali Msunduzi / Impendle (5pm - 7pm) Siyamu Georgetown Draaihoek Henley Hill Maqungwane Outlying Nhlazatshe Edendale Dambuza Mpoyinanda Caluza Siyamu Landauville Esogodini Henley Kwamntogotho Smeroe Esogodini, Georgetown Henley Minimzolo Zibomvini Mpumuza Craigie Lea Kwadlozi Kwamntogotho Kwampande Ntembeni Newcastle (7am - 9am) Drycut Madadni Massondale Musiskraal Newcastle (5pm - 7pm) Madadeni uMhlathuze / uMlalazi (5pm - 7pm) Amanzamnyama Duleen Fort Napoleon Mon Desir Nhlangenyuke Nsiwa Ongoye Senziwe uMkhanyakude (5pm - 7pm) Gazini Mloli Mfakubeka Nyenyane Thengani Thandizwe Pikinini Myamazane KwaMshudu uMshwati (5am - 7am) Broadmoor Ekuthuleni Swayimana Vuka Welgelegen Ekhukanyeni Gcumisa Ingqayizivele Kwasokesimbone Mbeka Mbhava Odlameni Saint Paul Swayimana Thuthuka Vukani Customers from affected areas are encouraged not to log a fault during this period.
