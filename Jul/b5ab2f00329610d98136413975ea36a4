Durban- An alleged KwaZulu-Natal south coast drug dealer was arrested following a high speed chase on the N2 freeway between Umkomaas and Winklespruit. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the 31-year-old suspect will be appearing in the Umbumbulu Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday. Gwala said police officers from Umkomaas SAPS saw a suspicious vehicle driving on the N2 freeway north in Ilfracombe and tried to stop the vehicle, but it sped off. A chase then ensued and the suspect was stopped. "Upon searching him and the vehicle, the crystal meth drugs were found. The estimated value of the recovered drugs is two thousand rands. A 31-year-old suspect was placed under arrest for possession of drugs. Umkomaas SAPS is investigating a case of possession of drugs," Gwala said. In a media statement, ET Tactical Response Team said police were informed of a suspected drug dealer heading towards their area via the N2. The suspect was being chased by the Umkomaas SAPS. "Our teams immediately mobilised at the various off ramps along the N2. It was not long and one of our vehicles spotted the suspect by Illovo. The suspect was driving at very high speeds, and very recklessly. A high speed chase ensued. The Durban Flying Squad, who was waiting at the Winklespruit off ramp, joined the chase, which continued back onto the N2. Just past the Winklespruit interchange, the suspect was boxed in by our TRT and the Flying Squad, and apprehended. Happy all members are safe - and one more drug dealer is off the street for now." Community crime activist George Snodey  said the most serious and addictive drugs are involved were crystal meth. "I have seen good people's kids hooked on these drugs, they wasted sleeping in the bush, walking the streets daily, discarded eventually by tired families, tired of paying for rehab, only for the kids to go back to it. These guys are murderers..." Daily News
