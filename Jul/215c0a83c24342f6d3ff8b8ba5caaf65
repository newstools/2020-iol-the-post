Durban - A 35-year-old man who allegedly raped his friend's girlfriend while she was passed out, was arrested more than a year after the incident. Provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said the suspect was arrested in Mount Aylif in the Eastern Cape and charged with two counts of rape. She said in January last year, the suspect had been drinking at a tavern in Sydenham with his friends and the woman. "The man's friend and his girlfriend had passed out and the suspect and two more men took turns raping the woman. When the woman woke up, she was angry and the men tried to calm her down. She reported the incident to Sydenham police and a case of rape was opened. The docket was then transferred to Inanda FCS for further investigation," she said. Mbele said a month after the incident, the suspect allegedly assaulted another young woman at a communal bathroom in Sydenham. She said the man accused the woman of swearing at him. "A 24-year-old woman who was with the one who was being assaulted protested and told the suspect that the female he was assaulting did not say anything to him. This angered the suspect who turned his attention to the 24-year-old woman and threatened her with a knife. He took her to his girlfriend's room where he raped her repeatedly," Mbele said. She added that the woman reported the matter to police. The docket was transferred to Inanda FCS for further investigation. Mbele said investigations traced the suspect to a Mount Aylif, where he was arrested. "The 35-year-old man will be charged with two charges of rape and will appear at the Durban Magistrateâ€™s Court on Friday," she said. The Mercury
