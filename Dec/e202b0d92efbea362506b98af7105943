Durban - An Estcourt father charged with the murder of his three-year-old son made his first appearance in the Estcourt Magistrate’s Court on Monday. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara-Ramkisson said the accused, Themba Majozi, 36, was charged with murder and possession of human tissue. Kara-Ramkisson said the matter was postponed until December 2 for the accused to undergo a preliminary mental observation. It is alleged that on November 26 at 9am, the grandmother was at her home in the Thembelihle area in Estcourt with her grandson when a known suspect entered and took the child. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said that when the grandmother returned from work on November 27, she noticed that the child was not at home. “The suspect was questioned about the whereabouts of the child but he became violent. That is when the family members decided to search for the missing child. At 2pm, the child was found in the bushes with a nail inserted into his skull and mutilated. “The police were immediately alerted and responded to the scene. A 36-year-old man was then placed under arrest for murder. The missing body parts were found inside the suspect’s house.” Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula condemned the killing of the innocent child. “I am glad that the suspect is behind the bars to answer for his evil deeds,” he said.
