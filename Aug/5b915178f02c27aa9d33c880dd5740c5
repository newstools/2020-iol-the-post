Durban â€“ A video showing a group of young women flashing handguns and pointing it at the camera has gone viral online with many expressing shock and outrage at their actions. A social media expert believes those captured on the video could face serious repercussions if identified. The 31 second video that is accompanied by loud Gqom music in the background has the lyrics ntombi zeygebengu - meaning girlfriends of criminals. Two young women each seated on a man's lap each hold what appear to be 9mm guns. The one woman points the gun towards the camera before moving the barrel towards her head while whistling along to the music can be heard. One of the young women in a black dress and heels kisses the gun before cocking it with her heel. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src="https://rumble.com/embedJS/uqnnu"+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+"/?url="+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+"&args="+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, "script", "Rumble");  She then cocks with her hand and it appears to empty. As the two move along to the music on their men's laps another young woman in black shorts and a fur coat walks in also carrying a gun and a can of alcohol. There are two men behind her and one them is also carrying a gun. Emma Sadlier with the Digital Law Company said everything on social can be used against those in the video. "Some people call it selfie incrimination, other people call it shooting yourself in the foot. Anything on social media like we saw with can be used in court. People can be identified and criminal prosecutions can be brought". Adele Kirsten with Gun Free SA said she was shocked at the video. Daily News
