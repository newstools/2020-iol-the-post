THE number of bodies that have been discovered in sugar cane fields in KwaZulu-Natal keeps climbing. This comes after a decomposed body was discovered in a sugar cane field along Vincent Dickenson Road in the vicinity of Thunder Town in Canelands, Verulam, on Wednesday. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said an inquest was lodged at the Verulam police station. “The DNA analysis will be conducted to determine the gender, identity and a possible date of death,” said Mbele. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said it was the third body discovered on the farm in recent months. Balram said two weeks ago Rusa had received an anonymous call about a decomposed body lying in a path between bush and a sugar cane plantation. Rusa officers and the SAPS K9 Unit conducted a vast search of the area without success. The search was called off due to the limited information provided by the caller. He said on Tuesday, they received a call from a farm employee reporting the discovery of the body. “On arrival, Rusa officers found the deceased in an advanced stage of decomposition. The gender or race could not be established,” said Balram. Other discoveries include: • July 11, the body of an unidentified man was discovered by farm workers, dumped in bush off Vincent Dickenson Road in Canelands. • July 6, the body of a 23-year-old woman was discovered in a sugar cane field in Hibberdene. She had a stab wound in her chest. • June 22, the naked body of Amanda Mthembu, 11, was found in a sugar cane field in Dokodweni Reserve. • June 2, 6-year-old Alexia Nyamadzawo’s body was recovered in a sugar cane field in Riet Valley, north of Durban. • May 21, workers discovered the body of a man while cutting cane in Canelands.
