Durban - Bus drivers employed by Tansnat Africa operating the Durban Transport fleet marched to the Durban City hall on Monday after bringing parts of the city to standstill when they blockaded the main roads with their buses early in the morning. They are demanding better pay and permanent employment. At the crack of dawn on Monday, hundreds of passengers were stranded and had to seek alternative transport when bus drivers abandoned their vehicles along some of the major routes N2 and N3 heading into and out of Durban, KwaMashu, Newlands and Umlazi. The bus driver's action caused massive traffic delays into the city which also affected passengers from the Ntuzuma depot servicing KwaMashu and Newlands. By mid-morning, most of the buses that were blocking the roads had been removed. Ethekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda denounced the blockading of roads with buses calling the action unlawful which would have a negative impact on the economy. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src="https://rumble.com/embedJS/uqnnu"+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+"/?url="+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+"&args="+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, "script", "Rumble");  “This is an act of treason and economic sabotage, to say the least, and those responsible must face the full might of the law. Our economy is very strained by Covid-19 and this unlawful conduct is compounding our woes. Transnat must move with speed and resolved whatever issues they have that resulted in this inconvenience," Kaunda said. "The management should have records of which driver took which bus to where. As a result, we are expecting the bus operator to discipline such drivers. We apologise to all residents and business that have been affected by these incidents and we are doing everything possible in our power for the situation to return to normalcy. This is a country that is governed by laws and all of us should respect the rule of law no matter what grievances we may have,” Kaunda added Among other grievances, bus drivers want to be permanently employed by the municipality.
