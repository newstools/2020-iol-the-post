Durban - THE matter where almost R1 million meant for the Tamil community went missing is now being investigated by the Hawks. This was confirmed last Tuesday by Premi Govender, the president of the South African Tamil Federation (SATF). Earlier this year, the POST published a series of articles on a 2004 BEE empowerment transaction from the sale of Telkom shares from which the Tamil community was expected to benefit. But the SATF said it had no record of the money being received. Karolia Jeena, the auditor who oversaw the transaction, said the KZN Tamil Business Forum motivated to be allocated shares on behalf of the Tamil community. To do so, it set up a private company called Four Arrows Investments 187 (Pty) Ltd. Four Arrows later changed its name to the SA Tamil Nadu Investment Company. On October 6, 2010, the SA Tamil Nadu Investment Company was paid out R910 086.74. The company has since been deregistered. The SA Tamil Nadu Investment Company indicated to the auditors that the money would be distributed to the KZN Tamil Federation, The Amma Trust, Force 500 Investments, Born Free Investments and four other individuals. Only the KZN Tamil Federation confirmed it had received 25% (R233 750) of the allocated shares and that the SATF was not allocated a benefit. The SATF has since launched an investigation into the matter, which has now been taken over by the Hawks. “The SATF would like to inform the public that the investigation of the SATF missing million is still open, and the case has now been handed over to the Hawks for further investigation. The executive has endeavoured to follow up on all evidence that is available. “We reaffirm that presently no leadership of the SATF past or present are being investigated, and we continue to hold them in high esteem,” said Govender. Govender said that any forthcoming information the public might have should be directed to the Secretariat of the SATF, Shirley Naran, at Shirley.naran@gauteng.gov.za or 083 554 1981. POST
