 Durban - SIX WEEKS have passed since Rakesh Nana died after contracting Covid-19, and last Thursday his remains were finally cremated. Nana, 40, of Worcester in the Western Cape, died on June 24. His body lay in state after a legal dispute arose between his immediate family and his sister and her children regarding who should perform the last rites according to Hindu customs. The matter was heard in the Western Cape High Court. In terms of health regulations, the body should have been cremated or buried within three days. According to Hindu custom, the disposal of the body should happen as soon as possible after death. Nana was separated from his wife, Praneshvari, for two years and they were finalising their divorce. The couple had two children – a son and a daughter. Since the separation, Nana had been living with his sister, Panna. When he died, his sister, with her two adult children, Aman and Nina, lodged a court application. They said that four months before his death, Nana signed an affidavit that he had commissioned at a police station that his last rites be conducted by Aman, who he had come to regard as his eldest son. The affidavit was submitted to court. Praneshvari rejected the application. She argued her son was the only one with the right to perform the last rites and collect his dad’s ashes. In the draft order made on July1, Avbob (the funeral parlour) were cited in the court application, was ordered to go ahead with the cremation at the first available opportunity. Avbob complied a month after the order was made. It blamed outstanding paperwork for the delay. The cremation was on Thursday at the Paarl Crematorium and the final rites were conducted by a priest. The ashes will remain with Avbob until August 17 when a final order is expected to be made on who will be legally entitled to them. The payment for the cremation and legal costs are also expected to be finalised. POST
