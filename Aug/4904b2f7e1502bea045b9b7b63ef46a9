Durban – THREE months ago, Dimitri Johnson left his job as a financial adviser in Johannesburg to return home to Durban to be with his parents. His father, Shakeel Johnson, said they wanted him to live with them in Clearhaven Place, Phoenix, during the lockdown. On Sunday, Dimitri, 23, was stabbed in the back, chest and neck. He died at the scene. Johnson said his son went to a tuckshop and, while returning home, he stopped to speak to friends. “We were told that he was leaning against his friend’s car when two men approached. One of them stabbed him in the back and when he turned around, he was stabbed in the chest and then his neck. Dimitri managed to get home. He shouted for me and then he fell in the driveway.” Johnson said the paramedics arrived and were treating him when he died. “It was the most devastating pain a parent could ever go through.” Johnson said he and his wife, Geetha, had been concerned that Dimitri was alone in Johannesburg during the pandemic. “We wanted him to come back so we could all be together. He was going for job interviews here.” He said there were rumours that his son was being harassed because of his quiet nature. “Just last week he had told me that he wanted to work this year and save enough money to study law. My child was robbed of his life.” Dimitri’s funeral was on Tuesday. He was buried at the Woodview Cemetery. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a provincial police spokesperson, said a case of murder was being investigated. “A suspect was arrested and charged with murder shortly after the incident.” Sheldon Moonsamy, 19, of Balehaven Place, appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. He was granted R10 000 bail and the matter was adjourned to October. POST
