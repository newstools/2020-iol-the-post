Durban - A teenage girl was killed and five other children were left injured after alleged car-jackers ploughed into them while evading arrest. The vehicle, a Ford Figo Ambiente, had been allegedly car-jacked in Parlock, north of Durban, when the incident happened on Monday. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said Inanda police were investigating charges of culpable homicide, reckless and negligent driving. Gwala said it was alleged that the incident took place at 6.30pm on Monday when six children were walking on a road at Emaplazini area when a vehicle travelling at a high speed lost control and knocked over six children who were on the road. Thereafter, the vehicle rolled down a bank. “The children were taken to hospital for medical attention and a 13-year-old girl later died. The other five are still in hospital,” said Gwala. She said it was established that the vehicle was car-jacked in Newlands East. Gwala also said the suspects were still at large. Meanwhile, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the carjackers ran over the children while evading first-responders. Balram said at 6.07pm, the tracking device on the Ford Figo Ambiente indicated that the vehicle was emitting signals in the Inanda area. Rusa officers, Tracker and Inanda police moved towards the signal. “The suspects were driving the vehicle and sped off when they noticed a Tracker vehicle approaching them. They lost control of the hijacked vehicle, ran over six children who were standing on the side of the road before plummeting down a steep bank. ’’The Ford Figo landed on its side and was wedged between two houses. The suspects managed to get out of the vehicle and fled the scene on foot,” said Balram. Daily News
