 Durban - A foetus was recovered from a sewage station in Durban on Tuesday. The foetus was found in the sewage station on Mahatma Gandhi (Point) Road near the Durban beachfront, next door to the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI). Life Response 24/7 operations manager Leon Fourie said on Tuesday afternoon, along with SAPS and Metro Police, they were called out to the waste water plant in the Point area after a foetus was found in the sewage system. “Rescue workers donned breathing apparatuses and climbed into the treatment system where they discovered the deceased remains of a male foetus believed to be of approximately 28 to 30 weeks in gestational age,” said Fourie. He said the remains were recovered and handed over to SAPS for further investigation and processing. On their Twitter page, the South African Police Services said Durban Search and Rescue, Metro Police and Life Response paramedics recovered a foetus in the sewage augers in the underground bunker at the eThekwini sewage station in Mahatma Gandhi Road in Point. “SAPS opened a concealment of birth case docket for investigation,” the tweet said. On August 4, members of SAPS Search and Rescue were called to assist Plessislaer police in Pietermaritzburg with a concealment of birth case next to Lay Centre in the Plessislaer area after a foetus was found on a rubbish dump. Police opened a case docket. On August 2, Life Response 24/7 paramedics were called out to Che Guevara (Moore) Road in Glenwood to recover a foetus. Fourie said paramedics and SAPS found a foetus in approximately the 28th week of gestation in a bin. “The scene has been cordoned off and an inquest docket will be opened by the Umbilo SAPS,” said Fourie.
