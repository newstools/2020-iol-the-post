DURBAN – A law firm in KwaZulu-Natal has collected 10 tons of rice from residents in the eThekwini region with which they plan to feed 250 000 people across the city. TPA Legal, a law firm founded by Theasen Pillay, and Food for Life, an organisation working towards eradicating hunger and malnutrition in South Africa, have partnered on the project. The organisations banded together after the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus, which they say left many people destitute and hungry. In the early days of the lockdown, Pillay’s humanitarian instinct kicked in, but that fire was quickly doused when he realised the magnitude of the problem. This is when he called on the public for help via social media. “This was a simple, earnest plea to help feed the increasing number of hungry. The response to the plea has been heart-warming and overwhelming. Within one month, people have contributed 10 tons of rice,” said Lisa Sukdev, spokesperson for TPA Legal. “We are in debt to those pensioners, who are just getting by yet still gave. To those businessmen and -women, family and friends that have responded to this plea. This is an encouraging example of how, when a community mobilises together, positively, the kind of impact we can create. "Collecting 10 tons of rice that will eventually feed 250 000 hungry people is a blessing,” said Pillay. “Food for Life has fine-tuned processes and is able to provide a nutritious, delicious cooked meal for just R5 per person. "This partnership with Theasen Pillay and his team at TPA Humanity has been fruitful and immensely rewarding. It is these catalytic relationships that enable us to reach further, do better and change communities,” said Viresh Panday of Food for Life. The team will be meeting on Thursday at the TPA Legal branch in Verulam, from where they will proceed to the Food for Life premises for the distribution to take place. African News Agency
