Durban - THE committee of the Muthu Mariamman Kovil in Port Shepstone will meet this week to discuss the way forward, after its temple was demolished. Vernon Govender, the chairperson of the temple in Umbango, said he was seeking advice from the South African Hindu Maha Sabha and the KwaZulu- Natal Amafa and Research Institute, the provincial heritage resources authority in the province. Last week, the temple, which dates back to 1915, was allegedly demolished by a local businessman. It is alleged that the businessman plans to build a shopping centre on the site. Govender said: “A lot of people are still hurt. This temple was one of the oldest and it has a rich history. Families have been visiting it for generations. “As the Hindu community, we will stand together for what is right, and we will promote and propagate Hindu dharma.” Govender added that the committee had contacted lawyers who were in the process of getting an interdict to prevent any construction. “We noticed that a structure has come up on the land where the temple used to be. We don’t know what it is, but we are working to get an interdict.” Ashwin Trikamjee, president of the South African Hindu Maha Sabha, said: “The committee has lodged a formal complaint with Amafa. Amafa is a body that researches old buildings and determines if they are heritage sites. They are waiting to learn the outcome from Amafa.” He said the committee was passionate about keeping the temple’s legacy alive. The property owner declined to comment. POST
