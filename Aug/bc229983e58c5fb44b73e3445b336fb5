Durban - THE family of Renardo Naidu want justice for his killing. Naidu, 20, of Newlands East, was found with gunshot and stab wounds to his body along Dumisani Makhaye Highway near KwaMashu last Sunday. He was taken to a clinic where he was certified dead. On Monday, police arrested five suspects, aged between 17 and 31, in connection with the killing. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a police spokesperson, said four men were arrested in Newlands East and the fifth suspect in Effingham Heights. They are expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court later this week. Naidu’s sister, Adele, said they were thankful for the swift arrest but they were not notified by the police. “He left home on Saturday (July 25) to go to a party in Newlands East but he didn’t take his cellphone with him. When he didn’t come home the next morning, we called his friends but they didn’t know where he was.” She said her family and friends searched for him and then reported him missing. “I felt something was amiss because he always came home after a night out. Last Tuesday, we were informed that a body was found near the highway.” Adele said she and her family went to the Phoenix mortuary to identify the body. “It was the most painful experience. On our way there, I was praying that the body was not Renardo’s. When I saw him, I just went cold.” She said she could not believe someone would do something so cruel. “I’m happy those responsible were caught. We want justice.” She said her brother, a Grade 10 pupil at Hillview Secondary, had been determined to complete his schooling. He was buried on Saturday. POST
