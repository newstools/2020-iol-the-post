Durban - The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs in KwaZulu-Natal has been placed on standby as the province braces for severe thunderstorms over the mainly western parts of KZN. Department MEC, Sipho Hlomuka, said a weather warning was sent out on Thursday, indicating severe thunderstorms over the western parts of the province this afternoon with possible heavy downpours, hail and strong winds. "It is predicted that parts of the Zululand, uMzinyathi, Amajuba, Harry Gwala and uMgungundlovu districts will be affected. Hlomuka has urged residents to take the necessary precautions, as hail poses a serious risk to human life, property and livestock. “Our disaster management teams are monitoring areas that are prone to such incidents so that they respond faster should the need arise,” said Hlomuka. Hlomuka has also urged residents to report any incidents to their nearest District Disaster Management Centre or their local councillors. Earlier this week, teams were placed on standby following a storm warning for the south-west areas inclunding Msunduzi, Mkhambathini, uMshwathi, Ubuhlebezwe and uMzimkhulu local municipalities.     Just last month, several homes were damaged during heavy rains in Msunduzi that caused the Msunduzi River to burst its banks. At least 56 houses were destroyed, leaving more than 200 people scrambling with just the clothes on their backs. Hlomuka said teams were sent to the area to assist residents with the clean up operations. He said blankets, plastic sheeting and food parcels were provided to affected residents. The Mercury
