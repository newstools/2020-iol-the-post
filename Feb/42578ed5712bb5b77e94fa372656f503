Durban - An loggerhead turtle whose flipper was entangled in fishing gut causing the flipper to rot has been rescued and is currently receiving medical treatment.    The KZN Stranding Network said it received a video from a free diver who had attempted to disentangle the turtle who had fishing gut wrapped around its flipper in the vicinity of the Durban harbour northern breakwater two days ago. According to Dr Jennifer Olbers from Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife members from the network went searching on Tuesday morning in the area hoping to spot the animal who had been seen two days before. "After searching for less than 20 minutes, with the spotter in the water and on the northern breakwater, the turtle surfaced for a breath and was rapidly caught," said Olbers.
