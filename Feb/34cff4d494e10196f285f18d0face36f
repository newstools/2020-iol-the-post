Durban - A convicted criminal who murdered an SAPS employee while out on parole has been sentenced to life. This week the Mtubatuba High Court sentenced Nhlanhla “Sathane” Mhlongo, 23, to life imprisonment for the brutal kidnapping and murder of Gareth Toohey in January last year. The court heard how Toohey, 38, an administration clerk at Sundumbili SAPS, was kidnapped by Mhlongo, who was known to him, on January 22. A day later police discovered Toohey's vehicle which was found burnt at a sugarcane field in the Nyoni area. "Not far from his burnt vehicle, his body was recovered. His hands and legs were tied with a rope and his body was burnt," said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. Mhlongo received an additional 15 years for robbery, five years for kidnapping and five years for malicious damage to property. Police said that during investigations police found that Mhlongo was out on parole for a robbery case committed in 2018. KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula hailed the sentence as a victory. "It sends a clear message to other criminals that wherever you are hiding we will find you. We hope that this sentence will bring comfort to the family and fellow collegues who lost their loved one. The sterling investigation conducted by the investigative team is commended." POST
