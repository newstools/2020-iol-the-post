Durban -  Police arrested two suspects with 57 cellphones, decoders, chargers and remote controls on their way from Durban to Mozambique. According to police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele the men were in a taxi when police pounced on them in Phelandaba. "During the raid police arrested the two suspects aged between 27 and 35 and found the stolen good in their luggage." The suspects were expected to appear at the Manguzi Court on Tuesday. They face charges of possession of stolen property. Last month a 28-year-old woman was arrested on January 20 on the R22 in Emanguzi. According to KZN police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker police were on the R22 conducting crime prevention operations when they pulled over a white Toyota Hilux with two occupants. "The driver spotted police and abandoned the vehicle as he fled the scene into nearby bushes. "The female suspect was found in the vehicle with 15 boxes which contained 60 units of cigarettes and 900 pairs of branded sneakers. "She was questioned with regards to the goods however she failed to provide police with a reasonable explanation for being in possession of the illicit and counterfeit goods. She was arrested and charged whilst the vehicle was impounded. Naicker said the estimated value of the goods was R1,2million. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended police for work along the borders. “It is pleasing to see that operations along our borders are bearing fruits. Our police officers are out in full force and criminals will have no place to hide in this province. We are pleased with the commitment displayed by our police officers as they fight crime and protect our communities living along our borders,” said Jula. POST
