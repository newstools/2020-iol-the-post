He said two occupants from the truck were treated on scene while rescue services used hydraulic tools to free them from the wreckage. "A fourth patient from one of the light motor vehicles had sustained moderate injuries. Once stabilised all the patients were transported by various ambulance services to hospital for further treatment," he said. The cause of the crash is yet to be determined and police are investigating further. Herbst added that their teams attended to two serious collisions on Thursday. He said the the first incident, a bus driver was critically in a crash between the bus he was driving an an armoured vehicle in the Durban CBD.
