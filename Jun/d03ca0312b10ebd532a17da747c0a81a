Durban - Two Durban Metro policemen were gunned down in Mpumalanga township, near Hammersdale, 40km north of Durban, on Tuesday. According to Metro Police spokesman, Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, the two traffic wardens were travelling in a private car towards the city when they came under attack. "The one officer was in the other's car. Police are at the scene and are investigating. The circumstances of the shooting is unknown at this stage," he said. Sewpersad did not know if the officers were armed and if their firearms were taken. "Police are investigating. We do not know a motive yet," he said. This is not the first incident of Durban Metro police officers coming under attack. In March, an off-duty metro cop from KwaZulu-Natal  was discovered dead in his vehicle, which was parked on the N2 near the old airport South of Durban, after being shot in the chest. In February, another metro police officer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting on the R102, near Verulam, north of Durban. He was alleged to have been a taxi owner. Inspector Nhlanhla Maphumulo, 44, was driving on the R102 (southbound) between Canelands and Verulam when the occupants in a white Toyota Corolla opened fire on his vehicle shortly after 4pm. His vehicle was shot at 10 times. In May 2019, Sergeant Zephania Dladla and Constable Nomasonto Mhlanga were killed while performing protection duties for Inanda councillor Moses Zulu at his residence in Bhambayi near Phoenix. Zulu was not injured in the attack. Daily News
