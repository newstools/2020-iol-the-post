Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said Phoenix police were investigating a murder after the unknown man, believed to be 35, was found with gunshot wounds to the head and body.

Naidoo said while searching, residents said they spotted two of the suspects running into the sports grounds and managed to catch one when he was trying to jump over a wall. “The community then brought the suspect on to the road and started assaulting him with sticks and baseball bats. Our GBH reaction officer urged them to stop,” said Naidoo. He added that was confirmed the house break-in concerned another security company and the GBH reaction officer left when the responsible security company arrived. As the GBH officer left, he heard gun fire and was told the suspect had run away. “He had then found the man covered in blood motionless and immediately called for SAPS and the GBH ambulance crew,” said Naidoo. He said paramedics found the man was shot in his head, back and leg and was pronounced dead on the scene.
