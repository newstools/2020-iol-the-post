LIFESTYLE - Are we really living in what is our “new normal”? While this is a statement used often lately, Rakhi Beekrum, a Durban counselling psychologist, put forward recently that this is not the new normal, but simply “the now”. Beekrum addressed a webinar on Covid-19 and mental health matters, hosted by the POST on its Facebook page.

For now, this is simply where we are.” Encouraging those who may be feeling anxious, depressed and fearful, Beekrum said these were normal feelings to have. “We started off 2020 with great visions and plans, and then the pandemic happened. But this is an obstacle in the road. It doesn’t mean all is lost. It means we need to recalibrate and find a way forward.” Beekrum said there were some positives to come out of the pandemic, like that it made us see values more clearly. “It will be a great pity if we come out on the other side of this unchanged. We must ask ourselves - how are we going to be better? Who are we going to be on the other side of this? How can we come out of this as better, more compassionate human beings?” She suggested we ponder the positives like our “post-traumatic growth”. “How can we grow from this and become better, stronger and more resilient from this experience? Let’s try to take away positives from this experience.” Beekrum suggested a number of coping mechanisms to help adjust to the change.
