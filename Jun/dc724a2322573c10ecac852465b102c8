LIFESTYLE - Keeping your skin and body in good condition involves a combination of exercise and healthy eating. Maintaining sober habits and a healthy and regular grooming routine are essential during the lockdown, especially over winter. Some basic tips to help your skin:   Coconut oil:   Honey:   Sugar: Sugar is an excellent exfoliator for the skin and lips but it can be a bit harsh, so opt for brown sugar which is generally softer. Mix it with an essential oil and gently exfoliate the skin before washing. Pimples/blackheads: There are many issues that can cause acne. Stress, hormone imbalance, irregular sleeping patterns, and the lack of blood and oxygen flow to the face are some. These can all be reduced with exercise. And make sure you shower right afterwards to avoid your pores from getting clogged.   * Singh is a brand ambassador for Skin Solutions and a partner at Millennial Media and Marketing.
